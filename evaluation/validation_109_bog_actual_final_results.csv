com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;"There is no “search” for people with DNA test results — You can only see if another person has taken the AncestryDNA test if we determine you are a potential match or otherwise related, or if someone has invited you to access their DNA test results. In addition, if you invite another user to access your DNA test results, they will also see information about your potential DNA matches.
You are identified by your display name — To configure how you are identified to matches, click on ""Settings"" on the DNA status page and adjust your display name. Tests managed by the parent or legal guardian of a minor child will show the parent or legal guardian as the “Manager” of the test. Only the child’s initials will be viewable by DNA matches along with the parent’s display name. The minor will become the “Owner” upon reaching the age of majority and at that time, as Owner, can choose their own display name.";False;False;[]

We assume an individual is living unless there is death information or his or her birth date is more than 100 years ago. If there is no birth or death information, we estimate dates by looking at relatives in the tree.;False;False;[]

Record Databases
In our extensive databases you may find information about living individuals; quite often this is information that has been made public by government institutions or other groups. Before we publish information on our site, we consider a number of things, including industry guidelines, rules, best practices, laws and regulations, and customer needs, so we can be thoughtful and responsible in our approach.";False;False;[]

How is my DNA data protected?";False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;"You trust us with your DNA so we, in turn, employ a number of measures to protect it; here are some of the things that we do:";False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;"The results of your DNA test are stored in a secured database — Your AncestryDNA results are stored in a secured database, which employs a number of security measures. As well as protecting the information from unauthorized access from those outside of AncestryDNA, we strictly limit access to this database from within the company.
The lab processing your DNA doesn't have access to your name, address and other contact information — DNA samples are tested in a secure third-party testing lab in the United States. We separate your name from your DNA sample throughout the testing process. Instead, we use a unique Activation Code provided in your kit to track your DNA through the testing process and in storage.
Your DNA sample is securely stored — After testing is complete, any remaining DNA from your test is archived and stored in a temperature-controlled, secure facility with 24-hour monitoring and limited access.
The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) — United States law (the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act or “GINA”) generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. Learn more about GINA here.";False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;You have the choice to delete your DNA test results — Once a DNA test result is deleted, that choice is permanent. You will no longer see the results in your account. Also, your DNA matches will no longer see your username among their list of matches. So be sure you want to delete a DNA test result before you do it, as there is no way to recover the data after it’s deleted.;False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;If you have given your consent to participate in ongoing research efforts and you delete your DNA results, your consent will be withdrawn and your information will not be used in future research.  Please note, however, that information cannot be withdrawn from studies in progress, completed studies, or published results.;False;False;[]

com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;"We will never ask you to disclose your password to us or anyone else, and you should not share it with anyone.
We recommend that you change your password periodically.
A strong password contains a mix of numbers, letters, and symbols and is only used for this account—and remember, especially given the nature of our sites, using your own or your relatives’ names or dates of birth is not a good idea.
Also, you should log out of Ancestry when you use a computer you share with other people.

Who can see my DNA results?";False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;Your DNA results are viewable to you, and also to your DNA relatives if you have opted in to seeing and being seen by them. Also, your DNA relatives will see your common ethnicity or your whole ethnicity estimate if you choose. Please note that your DNA relatives are Ancestry users that we believe are related to you. When you decide to see your relatives through AncestryDNA, your information will also be viewable to them. You should know that you might find a long-lost relative or you might find relatives that you did not know about or that are surprising to you. You could also find that someone you thought was related to you is, in fact, not. These aspects of DNA testing are all part of what makes us human, although some may challenge our visions of ourselves.;False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;Can Ancestry users contact each other?;False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;It is important to us that you feel safe communicating with other members of the Ancestry Community, so we’ve created an online messaging service that lets our users contact each other. When another user sends you a message, you’ll receive an alert in your Ancestry inbox and an email. You can respond through the Ancestry website without sharing any personal contact information with the sender (except your username). Ancestry stores these messages as described in our Privacy Statement.;False;False;[]

com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;What's the difference between public, private, and unindexed trees?;False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;When you create or upload a tree to the Ancestry Community you can determine whether it is public, private, or unindexed. By default, your tree will be public, because we believe that this will better help you find family members and share your family history. You can change this setting any time to a more private option by clicking “Trees,” choosing a family tree, and then selecting “Tree Settings”.  When you change your public tree to “private” or “unindexed,”  other users may continue to see your tree until we can complete your request, but they cannot access any record or document from your tree without your authorization.;False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;"If your tree is public: 
Other users can view all content in your tree except information about living people and notes. Other users can also see your username or full name depending on your account settings.";False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;"If your tree is private:
Other users cannot view the contents of your tree. However, limited information about deceased individuals in your tree (name, birth year, birthplace, and any documents you upload) will appear in search results within Ancestry Community sites. For example, if you upload a picture of a deceased family member to a private tree - while no one can view that picture from your private tree, search results for that individual might show limited information for the uploaded photograph (such as the name of the picture and the ancestor the image is tied to). If the searching party then tried to view the photograph from the search, the site would tell them that the image is in a private tree and that they would have to contact that user directly to view it.  A user could then contact you anonymously through the Ancestry messaging service, and you can decide whether or not to respond or give them access.";False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;"If your tree is unindexed (hidden):
Other users cannot view the contents of your tree and its contents will not appear in search results within the Ancestry Community. For example, no information about a document uploaded to your unindexed Private tree would show in a search. You can change your Private tree to an unindexed Privacy by clicking “Trees,” choosing a family tree, and then selecting “Tree Settings”. On the “Privacy Settings” tab select the “Also prevent your tree from being found in searches” checkbox.";False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;What happens when I share my tree?;False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;You can invite friends and family members to view and collaborate on your tree using their email addresses or Ancestry usernames. To invite someone to your tree, select the tree from the “Trees” button at the top of any Ancestry page, then choose “Share your tree” and follow instructions on how to share. You can assign each person one of these roles:;False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;People you invite to see your tree can participate in varying degrees. By default, all invitees are editors, but you can change this setting at any time. Choose from the following roles for your invitees:;False;False;[]

And you can change who can see living individuals at any time. Please note that you are responsible for ensuring that the living people in the tree that you want to share have consented to have their information shared.;False;False;[]

com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;Who can comment on my tree?;False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;"If your tree is public, other users can comment on your tree; if your tree is private, invitees can leave comments. As the owner of the tree, you can see who submitted the comment (their name or username) and message them.  For inappropriate comments, you can delete, flag, or hide the comment.";False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;Who can edit content in family trees?;False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;You control the content in your tree. You can update or delete facts and photos or change the content at any time. However, once something has been added to a public tree, the content may be copied and re-posted. If you delete an item in your tree, it may still be displayed in another user’s tree. Because of this, we encourage you to think carefully about what you post and share within the Ancestry Community.;False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;If you have a concern about information that someone has posted about you or a living family member please contact Member Services.;False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;Do I get credit for the content I post?;False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;Because Ancestry encourages our users to share their family history discoveries, we want you to get acknowledgment for what you share. Whenever you post a photo, story, comment, or message board post to the Ancestry Community, it will be linked to your profile. That way you receive credit for your work and other researchers know whom to contact for additional information.;False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;Remember that information you post within the Ancestry Community may become public to other users (depending on your privacy settings). This means that other users can copy and use the information you provide. If another user updates a person in their tree based on what you have shared in your tree, the information will include a source indicating that the information is from your tree. If they add a photo or story from your tree, it will show you as the original contributor. Although you may receive credit for your contributions, you don’t have total control over what others may do with the content you share.;False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;Remember, you are responsible for what you post on the site. Anything you post should be something you have permission to use (see the Ancestry Terms and Conditions for more details). You should also avoid posting content that could be offensive to other users (such as anything obscene, indecent, defamatory, or that incites hatred of any kind).;False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;Does Ancestry respond to law enforcement requests?;False;False;[]
com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;For all requests, Ancestry requires valid legal process in writing before producing any personal information about our users. We publish an annual transparency report describing requests we received. When we receive a request, our team reviews it for compliance with legal requirements and our policies. If we believe a request is overly broad, we will seek to narrow it. We notify users prior to turning over any information in order to give them an opportunity to challenge the request unless it would be counterproductive or we are legally prevented from doing so.;False;False;[]

com.ancestry.android.apps.ancestry;Ancestry may market to you online, via email, or through other methods, with new products and offers from us or our business partners. This includes advertising personalized to your interests. You can control how we market to you by using the unsubscribe link in any email you receive, by changing your account preferences, or by following the instructions in any other marketing communications you may receive.;False;False;[]

com.indeed.android.jobsearch;"A. Terms of Service for Job Seekers
 
 
1. Job Ads or Job Listings";False;False;[]
com.indeed.android.jobsearch;"Indeed may make available Job Ads advertising employment opportunities and other job-related content, including links to third-party websites (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”), through Indeed’s search results or otherwise through the Site. Searching for Job Ads on Indeed is free for Job Seekers. Job Ads are created and provided by third parties over whom Indeed exercises no control; you acknowledge and understand that Indeed has no control over the content of Job Ads, links to or from Job Ads, or any conditions third parties might impose once a Job Seeker has submitted an application or left the Site. For example, some of these third parties may attempt to charge Job Seekers a fee to apply to a particular job, although Indeed endeavors not to make such Job Ads available on the Site. If you leave the Indeed Site and choose to enter a third-party website, you accept any terms and conditions imposed by that third-party. Employer websites may have conversion trackers or use APIS and other functionality provided by Indeed, which informs us that an application has been completed on an Employer site. An Employer who installs such functionality is required under this Agreement to provide any notice, and obtain any prior consent, that may be required by applicable law. However, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed has no control over such an Employer or its website. You agree to Indeed’s use of, and receipt of information from, any such conversion tracker functionality. Except for sponsored, featured or paid placements, the Job Ads contained on, or linked from, the Site are indexed or posted in an automated manner. Indeed has no obligation to screen any Job Ads, or to include any Job Ads, in its search results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any Job Ads from the Site or your search result for any or no reason. You understand and agree that Indeed has no obligation to present you with any or all Job Ads. We cannot confirm the accuracy or completeness of any Job Ad or other information submitted by any Employer or other user, including the identity of such Employer or other user. Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Job Ads, Company Pages, screener questions and responses, and assessments. Additionally, Indeed may provide search options to narrow down Job Ads search results by job type categories (i.e. full-time, part-time, etc.), and such categories are created independently and entirely by Indeed, and may not directly or accurately reflect the content of the Job Ads. Indeed may reformat Job Listings so that you may read them more clearly on a mobile phone. Placement of a Job Ad on a certain page (for example, on Indeed Gigs) is not a representation regarding the nature of the role for legal purposes. While Indeed may in some circumstances be compensated by employers who post Job Ads, helping keep Indeed job search free for Job Seekers, all Job Ads are considered advertising. Indeed displays Job Ads based on a combination of employer bids and relevance, such as search terms, and other information provided and activities conducted on Indeed. You are not permitted to use Indeed’s Site or its content other than for non-commercial purposes. For purposes of this Section A of the Indeed General Terms of Service, all references to “you” or “your” shall mean you, the individual or organization accessing this Site in your capacity as a Job Seeker. Indeed may provide functionality to call a telephone number contained in a Job Ad using the phone app on a mobile device. Indeed cannot guarantee that the extracted phone number is the correct phone number for the Employer or for the Job Ad you are viewing.";False;False;[]
com.indeed.android.jobsearch;2. Resumes, Profile, and Recommended Jobs;False;False;[]
com.indeed.android.jobsearch;By creating a public resume through the Site (“Indeed Resume”) or uploading a file resume on the Site (collectively, “Your Resume” or “Job Seeker Resume”), you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available Your Resume to third parties, such as Employers, that Indeed believes may have an interest in Your Resume. If you do not want Indeed to make available Your Resume to third parties or if you do not want Employers to contact you, set your Indeed Resume and uploaded file resume to private. Setting Your Resume to private will not affect your previous applications or prevent employers you responded to from contacting you. You can read more about resume privacy here.;False;False;[]
com.indeed.android.jobsearch;By creating an Indeed Resume or uploading a file resume on Indeed, Indeed may share with you Job Ads that match the contents of Your Resume. Indeed may also highlight to you items in Your Resume that may match qualifications from the Job Ad, or highlight to you items that appear in the Job Ad and may be missing from Your Resume. These highlights do not mean you are or are not qualified for the job or that you should or should not apply for it. Applying for such Job Ads does not guarantee job interviews or hiring. Even where Indeed highlights items or a Job Ad is shared with you, Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of Job Ads or highlights. By creating or uploading Your Resume, you are requesting and authorizing Indeed, or an Indeed vendor, to review or scan Your Resume and provide you feedback (in Indeed’s discretion), including suggested changes. Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any changes you make based on any provided feedback. Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for the resume or application information you post, send or receive through the Site. By uploading a file resume on the Site, you agree that Indeed may convert your file resume to a different file type. It is your responsibility to review Your Resume to ensure that the content appears as you intend, and that it contains the right information or any information you intend to include or update. If you see any inaccuracy in any such material, it is your responsibility to correct such information or to contact Indeed to do so. It may take a few days for updates to your account or resume to be reflected. To mitigate fraud, Indeed may mask or hide your contact information, for example, we may mask or hide your email address and/or phone number, from Your Resume or application and may substitute it with an alias. Indeed makes no promise to you about whether all or part of your contact info will be masked or hidden, and the decision to mask or hide such info is in Indeed’s sole discretion. Indeed reserves the right to limit your ability to set Your Resume to public, and may toggle a public resume to private, at any time, to prevent illegal conduct, for fraud mitigation, or for any other reason in Indeed’s discretion. ;False;False;[]
com.indeed.android.jobsearch;If you have an Indeed account, an Indeed Resume, or an uploaded file resume, you agree that Indeed may associate Your Resume data with your profile on Indeed (“Indeed Profile”). Your Indeed Profile consists of information you provide on the Site in the “Profile” section of your account. This includes your Indeed Resume, your scores on any Indeed Assessments you may have taken and any information that you choose to include, such as your desired job title, job types, work schedule, whether you are ready to work, or pay. Information in your Indeed Profile, except as otherwise indicated on the Site, may be available to third parties, such as Employers. If you do not want Indeed to make your Indeed Profile available to third parties or if you do not want Employers to contact you, set your Indeed Resume and uploaded file resume to private or remove Your Resume. Your response to an Indeed Assessment will be associated with your Indeed Profile. You may choose whether your Indeed Assessment response is available to Employers viewing your Indeed Profile. You can enable the ready to work feature on your profile to let Employers know that you can start work immediately. Indeed may disable that feature from your profile after a certain time, but you can manually enable it again.;False;False;[]
com.indeed.android.jobsearch;Indeed may also automatically send you recommended jobs via the email address you use to create an Indeed account or apply to a job. Indeed may determine what these recommended jobs are on the basis of a variety of factors, including but not limited to, any information you input on the Site about yourself (including in Your Resume), searches you run on the Site, jobs you click on, jobs you apply to, or the materials you provide in a job application to an Employer through Indeed.;False;False;[]
com.indeed.android.jobsearch;3. Applying to Jobs Through Indeed;False;False;[]
com.indeed.android.jobsearch;Any resume or application information that you submit through the Site, including Personal Data included in a resume, application or responses to screener questions and assessments (“Indeed Apply”), is subject to this Agreement (including Section D.3.) and to Indeed’s Privacy Policy. Prior to submitting an application, you acknowledge that you are responsible for reviewing and confirming that you are applying to your desired Employer. Once you provide information to an Employer (whether in the form of a job application, resume, email, or otherwise), Indeed does not have control over the Employer’s use or disclosure of that information. If you want to request the Employer delete, modify, or maintain confidence over any such information, you must make such a request directly to the Employer. (All references on the Site to “Apply Now”, “Easily Apply”, “Simple Apply”, “Apply from your phone”, “Apply with Indeed”, “RSVP to hiring event” or any similar references mean “Indeed Apply.”) Indeed may use your application materials to determine whether you may be interested in a Job Listing, and Indeed may reach out to you about such Job Listing. Indeed may store such information regardless of whether a Job Listing has been closed or is no longer available on the Site. To maintain the quality of the Site and Services, Indeed in its sole discretion may impose limits on your ability to apply to Job Listings or to other Indeed services. In addition, when you indicate your interest in a Job Listing through Indeed Apply or by RSVPing to a hiring event you are sending your resume and application information to Indeed, and you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available such application information to the applicable Employer(s) for such Job Listing(s). When you ask Indeed to transmit an application or a message, including, but not limited to, a signed offer letter, to an Employer via Indeed Apply or Indeed’s relay system, or store such application, you understand that this is without warranty, and that Indeed reserves the right to reformat such application or message.;False;False;[]
com.indeed.android.jobsearch;You acknowledge and agree that Employers may request that Indeed assemble your application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, assessment responses and other information you provide to Indeed into one document, and you agree that in doing so, Indeed assembles these application materials on your behalf. When you apply for a job on Indeed you agree to Indeed’s performance of automated processing in relation to your application, as such processing is an essential part of this Agreement. Additionally, you consent to your application and any responses sent to you by the Employer (including offer letters) through Indeed being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.;False;False;[]
com.indeed.android.jobsearch;When you apply to a job using Indeed Apply, Indeed will attempt to send your application to the contact information provided to us by an Employer or their Agent, which may include sending your application to an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) selected by the Employer. We cannot guarantee that such messages and applications will be delivered, received, accessed, read or acted upon. Indeed also does not guarantee that any Employer will receive, be notified about, access, read or respond to any such resume or other application material, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data. Further, Indeed does not guarantee that the interface will be error-free. However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur. Please note that Job Ads may expire between the time you submit your application and from the time it is received. Indeed has no responsibility for expired Job Ads or for delivering applications prior to a Job Ad’s expiration. In addition we cannot vouch for the validity of the contact information provided to us by Employers. We also cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third party sites, including but not limited to ATSs. Third party sites, including ATSs used by Employers, may disclaim liability for technical malfunctions, including the failure in the delivery of applications. We are not responsible if an ATS rejects or fails to deliver an application to an Employer for any reason. If you do not feel comfortable sending an application or messages in this manner, or having your application or messages stored on Indeed, do not use the Indeed Apply or Indeed relay functions and please send your application or messages directly to the Employer by whatever other method you so choose, including the public mail system. You may contact the Employer directly to find alternative methods of application if you do not wish to apply through Indeed. By using the Indeed Apply system, you fully consent to the above.;False;False;[]
com.indeed.android.jobsearch;If you require alternative methods of screening or application you must approach the Employer directly to request such as Indeed is not responsible for the Employer application process.;False;False;[]
com.indeed.android.jobsearch;"By using Indeed, you agree that Indeed is not responsible for the content of the Employer’s job application, messages, screener questions, skills assessments or their format or method of delivery, and that Indeed does not guarantee receipt of your application by the Employer, or your receipt of messages from the Employer. Please note that Indeed does not choose the questions asked by Employers or decide the job qualification criteria of Employers. Some questions may be labeled as Optional, indicating only that the application may be submitted to the Employer without providing an answer. Indeed cannot guarantee that the Employer will consider such an application or make a particular determination with regard to such an application. Indeed may inform Job Seekers that an Employer’s requirement from a job description does not appear to be present on a resume or application; this information is presented without warranty and Indeed does not guarantee that updating a resume or application will result in any job offer. Indeed does not guarantee the identity of an Employer or any individuals working for any Employers, and cautions Job Seekers when applying to jobs. Indeed cannot make any guarantee regarding health and safety measures in an Employer’s hiring or interviewing process. Indeed recommends Job Seekers follow personal health and safety best practices as recommended by the World Health Organization or similar institution. Indeed does not guarantee the validity of a job offer and cautions Job Seekers to verify the validity of a job offer before taking an adverse action regarding their current employment situations. Job Seekers are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of any Employer or job offer.";False;False;[]
com.indeed.android.jobsearch;Indeed may send you a notice relating to account security, such as informing you that you may have recently interacted with a compromised account. Indeed cannot and does not guarantee that such notices will always be sent or received, and you therefore agree that Indeed bears no responsibility for doing so. Indeed makes no warranty regarding, and disclaims any liability for, the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or reliability of such notices.;False;False;[]
com.indeed.android.jobsearch;Indeed may use your application materials (including resumes and responses to screener questions) and the recency of your activity on Indeed to determine whether the words of any Job Seeker’s resume and answers to screener questions match the words of a Job Listing or Resume query, and vice-versa. You agree and consent that Indeed may differentiate those matching resumes and screener questions from those that do not match, and present them to Employers as matches or not matches. Indeed may also use such information in order to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant Job Listings and resumes to Job Seekers and Employers). Indeed may also highlight to you items in your prior application materials (including items in your resume and past responses to screener questions) that may match qualifications from the Job Listing, or highlight to you items that appear in the Job Listing that may not match your application materials. These highlights do not mean you are or are not qualified for the job or that you should or should not apply for it. Applying for such Job Listings does not guarantee job interviews or hiring. Even where Indeed highlights items or a Job Listing is shared with you, Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of Job Listings or highlights.;False;False;[]
com.indeed.android.jobsearch;By using Indeed Apply and answering screener questions, you acknowledge that Employers may have instructed Indeed to send out rejection notices if your answers do not match the answers sought by the Employer, and you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections. Indeed may offer Employers the ability to activate a feature on their account called Employer Assist. Activating Employer Assist means the Employer is instructing Indeed to send a message on the Employer’s behalf to the Job Seeker informing them that the Employer has determined not to move forward with their application. These notices are automatically sent after a period of time selected by the Employer, unless the Employer indicates to Indeed their interest in your application. You acknowledge and agree that Indeed has no discretion in the sending of these messages, and that any such messages are solely a result of the Employer’s decision to activate Employer Assist and to not take an action on your application on Indeed within the time period selected by the Employer. Any interactions the Employer has directly with you and not through a tool provided by Indeed (for example, calling or emailing you directly instead of through an Indeed Relay Service) are not visible to Indeed, and would not by themselves prevent an Employer Assist rejection notice from being sent.;False;False;[]

com.indeed.android.jobsearch;Indeed Assessments is an online tool for the provision and review of skills assessments selected by Employers (“Assessments”) and responses from Job Seekers (“Responses”) through the Site. Employers may use the Indeed Assessments tool to send you Assessments, to which you may provide Responses.

com.indeed.android.jobsearch;An Assessment only evaluates a particular skill. It does not evaluate a Job Seeker’s qualification for any job. Whether a particular skill is relevant to a job, or whether a Job Seeker is qualified or appropriate for a job, is decided solely by the Employer sending the Assessment and reviewing your Response. Receiving or responding to an Assessment does not guarantee a job or job offer, or a job offer at any particular salary, or any further communication or action by any Employer. An Employer is the sole party to determine whether a Response indicates a qualified Job Seeker. Employers may have instructed Indeed to send out rejection notices if you have not responded to Assessments in a manner acceptable to the Employer, and you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections.

If you require an accommodation, or any alternative method(s) of Assessment, screening or application, you must indicate it to the Employer. Indeed may provide a means by which you may request such an alternative method or other accommodation from the Employer; Indeed does not guarantee the Employer’s receipt of, or response to, any such request.

Indeed may aggregate the results of all Job Seeker-selected Assessments for the purpose of displaying the percentile for Your Response.

Employers may also request that Indeed add such labels. Indeed shall determine the method by which such labels or badges are determined or which Employers qualify. The lack of a label or badge may indicate that Indeed does not have sufficient data to determine if an Employer qualifies. Some of the data may be provided by the Employer and Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of such data. Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of any label or badge that is added to Employer names or Job Ads based on employer provided data, including data on Job Ads.

You know exactly what this data is because you are the person who provided the information or undertook the activity and the data pertains only to your activity. If you have an Indeed account or a Job Seeker Resume, you agree that Indeed may associate this data with your Indeed Profile and use this observed factual data to suggest jobs to you and to suggest you or your public resume to Employers that might be interested in a person who matches your behavior on Indeed. You also agree that Indeed may contact you based on this observed behavior or provided info on behalf of Employers or Indeed itself. Please note, the aforementioned actions do not include information sent to you by a third party, however, Indeed may publicly display the fact that you have recently used the Indeed Site to correspond with a third party.

Any interactions you have directly with a Job Seeker and not through a tool provided by Indeed (for example, calling or emailing a Job Seeker directly instead of through an Indeed Relay Service) are not visible to Indeed, and will not prevent an Employer Assist rejection notice from being sent.

Indeed does not guarantee reach, performance, or placement of Job Ads, and distribution on Indeed or Other Websites. Performance and placement of Ads may vary depending on Indeed’s consideration of various factors, such as demand, industry, type of role, sponsorship, and other considerations.

Click prices may vary based on a variety of factors, including without limitation the current supply and demand pertaining to advertisements and clicks, traffic on the Site, time of day, and other factors.

All dashboards will reflect the total click count, including the clicks that open an Indeed reformatted or hosted page or Other Websites. In the event you provide Indeed with an indication that you are looking to fill your role in a short time period, as determined by Indeed, Indeed may add a label (such as “Urgent”, “Urgently Hiring” or similar) to your Job Ad.

If your charges are based on the third option, the number of Applies on your analytics dashboard is updated after the specified time frame has elapsed. For all options, Indeed does not verify Job Seeker responses, nor do we confirm the accuracy of such responses. Indeed may offer estimates regarding the number of Applies for a given budget; this information is based on estimates only and is not a guarantee of future performance or of any particular number of Applies. By selecting a desired number of Applies on the Site, you are requesting Indeed to display your Job Ad in Indeed’s sole discretion, using the budget you have selected.

Indeed may also limit the number of free Job Ads you are allowed to post at a given time in Indeed’s sole discretion. For example, we may require you to sponsor the following types of Job Ads: identical jobs posted in multiple locations, jobs posted with a confidential or generic company name, jobs that are commission only, hard-to-fill jobs, jobs posted by a staffing agency, recruitment process outsourcer, or other recruitment-based company, and any other jobs as determined by Indeed.

com.indeed.android.jobsearch;Use of the Indeed Resume Search Program (“Program”) by an individual who posts his or her resume on the Site (hereinafter, “Resume Owner”) or Employer on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed best-practice guidelines, policies and other terms and conditions made available to you, including through the Site, on the subscription or plan purchase page, and on the FAQ and information page(s) for the country you are purchasing a subscription or plan for, any or all of which may be modified at any time. Purchasing additional subscriptions or plans, or modifying subscriptions or plans may reset the monthly billing date for subscriptions or plans associated with your account, resulting in pro rata charges to account for the new date. If you purchase a new plan in India during the duration of your current plan, the new plan will begin after your current plan ends.  You shall not use any information obtained from the Site except for internal use in selecting and contacting Resume Owners, through Indeed, for purposes of filling your Job Listings. You shall not use the Indeed Resume Search Program for  any directly or indirectly illegal, discriminatory, or fraudulent purpose. You are solely responsible for your use of the Program, including but not limited to, how you search for Job Seekers, who you decide to contact, and any employment related decisions you make. Contact information provided by Indeed, including any Relay Service email address, is for your individual use only and may not be shared with any other person. You are expressly forbidden from using any product or system intended to extract the information from a Resume, in order to circumvent the Resume contact system. Use of such system will result in your immediate termination from the Program. In addition, as a feature of the IRSP, Indeed may send emails to Job Seekers on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for the Job Seeker’s resume. In some circumstances, Indeed may limit the number and/or frequency of times you may contact a Job Seeker through the Site. For example, if you contact a Job Seeker, and the Job Seeker does not express interest or contact you back, you may not be able to contact them again for a period of time.;False;True;['(hereinafter']

Your use of the Program is subject to all Indeed Site Rules and policies, including the Indeed Privacy Policy and any policies pertaining to Relay Services. Indeed does not guarantee that the email address is still in use, that such message will be received, that such message will be read, that such message will be acted upon by any potential Resume Owner, or that any Resume Owner’s resume or information thereof is valid, accurate or complete in any respect. Indeed may return different results for the same resume search query and has full discretion with respect to the resumes or profiles it presents in response to any particular search. ;False;False;[]
com.indeed.android.jobsearch;" Indeed does not allow its Program, including but not limited to, resume contact service to be used in a spam like manner, and you expressly agree not to use the Program service in such manner. Indeed defines “spam like manner” as sending requests for job positions to persons who are, as indicated by Indeed experience and/or Resume Owner behavior and reaction, unsuited for the role or who have indicated that such requests are unwanted. Indeed reserves the right to disable Indeed Resume Search contact service for any user who, in Indeed’s sole discretion, violates these IRSP Terms, including the foregoing term. We reserve the right to drop any message, including without limitation dropping any message with an .ade, .adp, .bat, .chm, .cmd, .com, .cpl, .exe, .hta, .ins, .isp, .jar, .jse, .lib, .so, .dll, .lnk, .mde, .msc, .msp, .mst, .pif, .scr, .sct, .shb, .sys, .vb, .vbe, .vbs, .vxd, .wsc, .wsf, .wsh, or .zip attachment or any other attachment containing scripts, macros, or other code, or other messages that Indeed suspects to be malicious or spam, or for any or no reason. The only acceptable use of the IRSP is for you to contact a Resume Owner through Indeed regarding a Job Listing or potential employment. No other uses of the IRSP are permitted. Scraping the Indeed Resume Search database, which may include any Job Seeker Resume, or using the Indeed Resume Search database for any other purpose except as allowed will result in legal action being taken against you. We may in our sole discretion place limits on your ability to run searches using Resume Search if we suspect that your use may adversely affect Indeed’s system, you are using the Resume Search in a malicious or objectionable manner, or you have violated this Agreement. Additionally, if you are a competitor of Indeed (including but not limited to any job aggregation website or any job posting websites) you may not use the Indeed Resume Search database to contact a Resume Owner for the purpose of sending them a job offer from your clients, and any such competitive use of the Indeed Resume Search database may result in Indeed blocking you from the Site, blocking you from contacting Resume Owners, and blocking your contact emails to those resume owners without notice and you consent to the same. Indeed may limit the number of devices each account is logged into. Except for plans in certain markets, such as India, where you have the option to assign additional seats to a plan, each Resume subscription or plan is solely for the individual use of the person to whom it is assigned, and may not be shared with other users. If you have a plan in India, you agree that adding seats to the plan does not add additional contacts to the subscription plan; if you add a seat on a day after the subscription plan has started, the price you pay for that seat is prorated, however, the number of contacts remains unaffected. For plans in India, once the time period on your subscription plan expires, so will any remaining contacts; no unused contacts will carry over to your new plan.";False;False;[]

com.indeed.android.jobsearch;ITA Apply: In order to participate in ITA Apply, you must either use Indeed Apply to receive applications or add Indeed’s conversion tracker snippet to the last page of your job application, also known as the post-apply page (the “Post-Apply Page”). The Post-Apply Page on which you add Indeed’s conversion tracker snippet shall be determined by mutual agreement between you and Indeed. However, please note that if you unilaterally place the conversion tracker snippet on a page other than the mutually agreed upon page, in violation of this agreement, Indeed will still count this page as the Post-Apply-Page, charge you for any Applies (as defined below) on this page, and may require you to correct the placement. Any removal of the tracker snippet, or any provision of a method, for Job Seekers to apply to the Job Ad, bypassing the conversion tracker snippet will disqualify you from the program and will entitle Indeed to any resulting damages. It shall be your responsibility to inform your job applicants that such tracker snippet is in place. The conversion tracker will attribute an application to Indeed any time the Job Seeker started their search on Indeed, despite any intervening activity. Additionally, if you receive the ITA Apply services, you may be given the option to include application questions for your Job Listing on an ITA ad as part of your application process. If you request that Indeed include the questions you have chosen as part of your ITA ad, you acknowledge that Job Seekers who do not answer your questions in the manner set forth in your instructions may not be permitted to proceed with the application process through the ITA ad, and that you are requesting that Indeed perform this action.

Applies are defined as a user visit to the agreed upon Post-Apply Page. For non-video ads (also known as display ads), ITA Brand Impressions are defined as an ad appearing on a page of the Site or a third party site, including, but not limited to, mobile apps, which page has been presented to a user. For non-video ads as well as video ads, ITA Brand Impressions may be counted differently depending, in part, on the website(s) on which they appear, since each third party website or service that facilitates displaying ads on such websites may count impressions differently (Indeed relies on these third parties for measuring impressions). However, in all cases, ITA Brand Impression does not guarantee that a Job Seeker has viewed an ad. If you are an Employer using ITA Brand, your price per ITA Brand Impression found on any ITA Brand Insertion Order is defined as the cost per 1000 impressions. If your ITA Insertion Order does not contain an end date, you will continue to be billed until you contact Indeed and request to be removed from the ITA Program. If your Indeed employer account has a credit card on file for the Indeed Ads Program, we will charge that same credit card for your Indeed Targeted Ads. If your billing address is in the United States, you shall pay all charges in US Dollars. If your billing address is in India, you may only pay all charges in Indian Rupees.  If your billing address is in Brazil, you may only pay all charges in Brazilian Reais.

This choice of currencies will be fully subject to Indeed’s discretion. Charges are exclusive of taxes, including VAT. You are responsible for all taxes as applicable and appropriate. You are responsible for paying (y) all taxes and government charges, and (z) reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting late amounts. If you are in Japan, Japanese consumption tax will apply on the import of all Indeed products and services. You waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Indeed’s Apply measurements, click measurements, or ITA Brand Impressions measurements. Indeed’s measurements may include measurements from third-party vendors. Indeed disclaims warranty with respect to measurements provided by third-party vendors. Indeed’s determination of the number of Applies, clicks or ITA Brand Impressions shall be binding, even in cases where this number encompasses measurements provided by a third-party vendor. Refunds (if any) are at the absolute discretion of Indeed and only in the form of advertising credit for Indeed Property.

Our Privacy Policy explains our principles when it comes to the collection, processing, and storage of your information. The Cookie Policy specifically explains how we, our partners, and users of our services deploy cookies, as well as the options you have to control them.
What are cookies?
Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to ‘remember’ you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a ‘session cookie’) or for multiple repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’). They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in. Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as ‘first party cookies’), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website (‘third party cookies’).
Cookies Policy
We use cookies for a number of different purposes. Some cookies are necessary for technical reasons; some enable a personalized experience for both visitors and registered users; and some allow the display of advertising from selected third party networks. Some of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a visitor takes a particular action (clicking the ‘like’ or ‘follow’ button on a post, for example).
Below the different categories of cookies set are outlined. This includes their name and purpose. Certain cookies are only set for logged-in visitors, whereas others are set for any visitors, and these are marked below accordingly. Where a cookie only applies to specific subdomains, they are included under the relevant header.
Strictly Necessary: These are the cookies that are essential for us to perform basic functions. These include those required to allow registered users to authenticate and perform account related functions.
Functionality: These cookies are used to store preferences set by users such as account name, language, and location.

 This dash cam saved me on July 10, 2021. As you can see in the video, the U-Haul comes over the double yellow line and smacks my mirror on a brand new truck with 2500 miles. When the Georgia State Patrol arrive I told my side of the story. He told the GSP that he was in his lane. When I showed the GSP the dash cam video, he realize the other driver had lied & put the U-Haul driver at fault. It saved me $500 for my insurance deductible!";False;False;[]

com.opera.mini.native;Privacy Statement;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Last updated: October 13, 2021;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Introduction;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;This is the privacy statement of Opera Norway AS (“Opera”), an Opera group company. The statement applies to all Opera software applications, websites and services.;True;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;As a general rule, users of our software applications and services are anonymous to us, and we have no feasible ways to identify you. However certain categories of data may be collected while using our applications and services, and some of this information may be considered “personal data” by the law. When we collect personal data, we generally act as a “data controller” as defined in applicable law. The exact categories of data we collect, why we collect it, and your opt-out choices depend on the application or service you use, as is more fully described below.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;When we post changes to this privacy statement, we will include the date when the statement was last updated. If we significantly change this statement, we will notify you about the upcoming change via our website or using in-app notifications. We encourage you to review this statement periodically.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;User-submitted Data;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Certain pieces of information we will only process when you submit it to us.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;When creating an Opera account we may ask for a preferred username and an email address. The email address will be used to identify you as a user and for password recovery. Alternatively you can use your Facebook, Google+, Twitter, or VK account to sign in into an Opera account and access our services with the same profile. In this case we may collect your name and email address from these social networks. You can delete or modify the submitted data using your profile page. We retain your data for seven days after you’ve decided to discontinue your Opera account in case you change your mind. Your Opera account with a verified email address will be deleted automatically if you don’t sign in for 2 years. Accounts with unverified email addresses will be deleted after 6 months of inactivity.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Note also that Opera allows you to sync your browser data, such as Speed Dial entries and bookmarks, between devices that have another Opera browser installed on them. Profile sync relies on your Opera account and follows the same privacy approach.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;If you decide to provide feedback to Opera or participate in a promotional campaign, contest, or survey, organized by Opera or our partners on behalf of Opera, we may ask for information such as your name, age, phone number, email or postal address.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;If you agree to receive marketing information from Opera via email, SMS, or push notifications, we may use third-party technology providers to deliver such messages to you. You can opt-out from marketing communication at any time in your user profile settings or directly from a marketing email you receive.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;If you submit your phone number or email address on an application download page, we may send you a download link via SMS or email for your convenience.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;If you represent one of Opera’s customers or suppliers and have submitted data about your organization’s directors or officers in the course of a due diligence request from Opera, this information will be retained for three years.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;We will use this data only to provide the services you have requested and will not retain your data any longer than necessary to fulfill that specific purpose. If you’re not comfortable with us using submitted data for a limited purpose, then don’t provide it to us.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Anonymous Usage Statistics;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;When you install an Opera application, a random installation ID is generated. We may collect this identifier, as well as your device ID and hardware specification, operating system and environment configuration, and feature usage data.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;We use this information for certain legitimate business purposes, namely:;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;"To understand better how people interact with our applications and services;
To enhance, modify, customize or otherwise improve our applications and services;
To determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns and advertising;
To detect, debug and fix crashes in our applications and services;
To prevent security breaches and abuse.";False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;In short, this information helps us to improve our products and services. We have no practical way to use this information to identify you personally. We may store this usage data for up to three years. If you would like to learn about your opt-out choices, please refer to our help pages.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;To provide you with more relevant news content in certain countries and languages, we collect some information about the articles you read in the application’s native news feed, and your general location. This information is linked to a randomly generated News ID and may be stored on our servers for up to three months.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Personalized Ads;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Based on advertising IDs and your general location, some of our mobile applications may serve targeted ads. These ads are provided by our monetization partners. You can always adjust your personalized ad choices in the application’s “Settings” menu or through your operating system’s settings.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;We collect this data pursuant to our legitimate business interests. As noted in our End User License Agreements and Terms of Service, our applications are ad-supported. Collecting this information helps us offset the costs of our business and helps provide a more personalized experience for the user.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Crash Reports and Logs;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;If an Opera application crashes, we collect a log that includes some information about your browser’s version, your operating system, platform and some memory data related to the crash. We collect this data with the sole purpose of improving our products and services. Crash logs are kept for 6 months.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;If you visit our websites, we may collect your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our websites. We use IP addresses solely for this purpose and may keep website access logs up to six months.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Feature-specific Data Points;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Browser Assistant. Your copy of Opera for computers may include a component that displays desktop notifications promoting the browser’s features. It checks if any notifications are pending on a scheduled basis and may anonymously report occurrences of certain system events (namely low battery, low hard disk space, new Wi-Fi network connected, another browser installed). This information is not collected by us and no personal information is sent.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Browser Extensions. When you install extensions from the Opera Addons website, please note that these extensions are often developed by third parties and are subject to their own privacy terms. Please carefully review the terms before installing extensions.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Browser VPN. When you use our built-in VPN service, we do not log any information related to your browsing activity and originating network address.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Data Compression. Extreme-savings mode (in Opera Mini) renders web pages on our servers before sending a compressed version of the content to the application on your device. High-savings mode (Opera Turbo) does not render content, but our servers look through your requests to see if any elements on the page can be compressed before sending them to your device. If you use Opera Mini or Turbo data compression features, we log a randomly generated ID, advertising ID (on mobile devices), your IP address and URLs of your requests that are sent through our servers, but not the content. We may also log a phone number and IMEI, if they were provided by your mobile operator. We use this data to debug and improve our services, and we may store it in our server logs for up to 45 days. Then we anonymize and aggregate this data and may allow our business partners access to it.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Default Search Engines. When visiting some search engine websites, the website may query if it is set as the default search engine in the application’s settings, and suggest to set itself as the default search engine.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Dify Cashback. Dify Cashback is an incentive program where you can earn rewards when purchasing goods or services from participating online merchants. When you enable the Cashback service in the browser and visit supported websites, we’ll collect a merchant’s URL, list of your purchased items, transaction amount, and IP address. This data is required for the Cashback service to function, and we may also use it to provide more relevant partner deals, detect fraud and misuse of the service. To enable payouts, your Opera Auth account will be linked with the payment service provider, which will share your customer ID with Opera. Your data will be stored for up to 5 years due to regulatory requirements, and the account itself can be deleted by yourself or automatically after 2 years of inactivity.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Gamebox. Gamebox is an online service and a website including a community for gamers where you may be able to play, download, or purchase games. If you choose to use Gamebox, you will be prompted to create a Gamebox account, and to supply certain data, including your email address, preferred username, first and last name, gender, date of birth, country and city of your residence. We use this data to profile your gaming interests, and to offer recommended games based on your interests. If you’d like to delete your Gamebox account or exercise your personal data rights, please contact us at ogamebox@opera.com.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;GXC. GXC is an online service and a website including a community for gamers where you may be able to play, compete, and create games. To play games no account is required, however to participate in e.g. challenges or to create games you need to create an Opera account. After signing up for the first time you will be prompted to provide your date of birth and an optional avatar. We use the date of birth to ensure you are eligible to use the service. If you’d like to delete your account or exercise your personal data rights, you have the option from the Opera account page to perform this action.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Hype. Depending on where you live, you may be able to access the Hype messaging service. If you choose to use Hype, you will be prompted to give us your phone number, which is required to operate the service. You will also be asked if you agree to give us access to your contacts, in order to connect with other Hype users (but you do not need to give us your contacts in order to use the service). We will retain your phone number and contacts for as long as you use Hype. Additionally, you also have the option to upload profile information at your discretion, including a user name, avatar, and your friends. If you delete your account, or go inactive for a while, we will retain this data for a short period of time in case you decide to reactivate.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Loomi by Opera. Depending on where you live, you may be able to access the Loomi Service to stream or download movies and other content from within the browser or via the Loomi.tv website. If you use the Loomi Service, Opera will collect the following data:;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Opera Auth account data. Using Loomi requires creating an Opera Auth account. We use your Auth account data to provide and administer the Loomi Service, for example to determine your default language, to list titles you have watched and payments you have made, and to inform you about changes to the Service. We retain this data for as long as your Auth account is active (as described above).;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Content-related data. We collect data, such as the titles you have viewed, titles you have rented, and where you have left off in a movie, in order to manage your account and so that you can resume viewing at a later time. We also collect additional data, such as your IP address and a unique, randomly-assigned internal identification number, in order to comply with certain legal and/or contractual obligations, such as ensuring that you are located in a territory covered by the applicable content license, and detecting abusive or illegal use of the Loomi Service. Information about titles and views is associated with your Opera Auth account and will be retained for as long as your account is active. IP address and internal identifiers are deleted as soon as you close the applicable tab or navigate to a different tab.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Usage statistics. We collect information, such as user agent, operating system, IP address and content identifiers, for the purposes of debugging and improving the Loomi Service. This data is retained for up to 45 days.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Third Parties. If you use Loomi, we may share data with suppliers or other third parties for different purposes. If you choose to make a rental purchase via Loomi, data will be collected by our third-party payment service providers, such as PayU. We also use suppliers such as EZDRM to manage content license compliance, and Neutrino to detect improper VPN usage.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Malicious-site Check. We use a fraud prevention framework and check the URLs you visit against lists of known, malicious websites to protect you online. We don’t store or share this data.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;My Flow. If you use the “My Flow” function in Opera for computers or the Opera Touch browser, a random ID is generated by the Flow server and assigned to each client device. These IDs are used solely to enable pairing functionality between desktop and mobile applications and persist only while your devices are connected to My Flow. Your data is protected with end-to-end encryption and we retain it only as long as you continue to use the feature. You can disconnect your devices from My Flow, and delete your data through the application’s Settings menu.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Social Login. Some of our applications use Firebase Authentication by Google to provide a quick and simple authentication service for your user account. To enable this service, you agree to share your email, phone number, user-agent string and IP address of your device with Google and Opera. All the information is needed to provide and improve the service. Please refer to their websites to learn more about Google and Firebase privacy policy.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Use of Cookies;False;False;[]

com.opera.mini.native;International Data Transfers;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;When we do collect personal data, such personal data may be transferred to partners in countries outside of the European Economic Area with a different level of data protection than that provided for under European law. Whenever we do so, we require that our partners agree to the European Union’s model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries (also known as the “standard contractual clauses”) to ensure adequate protection of your personal data.;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Third Parties;False;False;[]
com.opera.mini.native;Our applications and services include third-party technology or code, some of which may use your data in different ways. When such third-party technologies use previously collected data, they typically act as data processors for us.

com.pandora.android;"The cookies we place on your hard drive are known as ""first-party cookies."" We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You may be able to remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your browser's ""help"" section. If you do not accept first-party cookies you may still use our Service, but your ability to use some areas of our website, and the ability to stay logged in, will be limited.";False;False;[]

When HTML content containing a Beacon is rendered, the Beacon transmits information to a server, such as a numeric count, unique identifier, or IP address. Pandora and its partners use Beacons to help us better manage content on our Service. For example, we may place a Beacon in HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened, or on a webpage to count the number of unique visitors to that page. The use of a Beacon may also allow us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and of our marketing campaigns.";False;False;[]

For example, we use Local Storage to keep track of the current song playing in the event your browser window reloads inadvertently, that way we can continue playing that song starting at the same position it was prior to reload. Our advertising and technology partners may use Local Storage to detect your bandwidth speeds for optimal video playback performance. Each browser implements HTML5 Local Storage differently and provides tools for managing content stored within local storage. You can review your browser's privacy settings to manage the content stored within HTML5 Local Storage. Similarly, for more information on how to manage content stored with Flash Local Storage, please review this document provided by Adobe.";False;False;[]

In some instances, transparent images are tied to users’ personally identifiable information. In particular, we use transparent images in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications. Users may opt out of these e-mails by replying to the unsubscribe link at the end of the e-mail message.;False;False;[]

Interest-based advertising (also known as targeted or personalized advertising or ads) is advertising based on your interests as inferred from your activities over time on the Digital Services and online services operated by third parties, as well as information from other sources, including information collected offline. Interest-based ads may consist of text ads, images, animations or videos and may be displayed to you based on various factors, including the context of the site or app in which they appear (e.g., sport or travel section), information you provided to the operator of the site or app (e.g., when you created an account), your activities on the site or app (e.g., pages viewed, searches performed or ads clicked), and information such as your demographic, interests and household information.
On the Digital Services and on third-party sites, apps or other media, we, our service providers and third parties may use automated means to (a) collect information for interest-based advertising purposes or (b) serve you interest-based ads. These automated means vary depending on the Digital Services and include technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, pixels, local shared objects (including HTML5 cookies) and SDKs. These technologies may use unique identifiers associated with your browser or device to support interest-based advertising.
We may use and/or combine online and offline information we obtain about you, including your personal information, for interest-based advertising purposes. We may aggregate the information we obtain to create audiences that are most likely to respond to ads based on demographic, interests or household information.
Interest-based ads may be displayed to you by third parties, such as ad networks or exchanges.
There are steps you can take to limit the collection of your information for interest-based advertising purposes. These steps vary for the web and mobile app environments and are browser and device specific. To learn more about interest-based advertising and opt-out choices, see http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and in the section Interest-Based Ads Opt-Outs.
In serving interest-based ads, we adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital Advertising Alliance.
Cross-device linking. If you access the Digital Services from multiple browsers or devices, we, our service providers and third parties may try to establish connections among and link the different browsers and devices you use to access the Digital Services and our content or ads published elsewhere. This helps us provide you with a seamless experience across the browsers and devices you use and serve you with more relevant content and ads (e.g., so that we don’t show you the same article twice).

com.shpock.android;"The finderly GmbH, Gertrude-Fröhlich-Sandner Straße 2, SPACES Icon Tower, Turm 9, 1100 Vienna, Austria (hereinafter referred to as ""Operator"") operates websites (shpock.com and other country specific top level domains like e.g. .co.uk, .de, .at) and mobile apps (Shpock app for Android, Shpock app for iOS) (hereinafter collectively ""Shpock"" / ""Shpock services""), under the name ""Shpock"". The Operator is the controller of personal data within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Operator decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data and is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the processing takes place in accordance with governing personal data legislation.";True;True;['(hereinafter']
com.shpock.android;I Preamble;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;The Operator takes data privacy very seriously and wants to reveal openly and transparently how this topic is dealt with.;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;"When Shpock is used, the Operator is provided with a set of personal data. Personal data means information which can directly or indirectly be linked to a living natural person. Examples of personal data include name, address, telephone number and email address; however, information about IP numbers and user behaviour when using the services may also constitute personal data. Below, the Operator explains to the users of Shpock (hereinafter referred to as “user” or “users”) how data, what kind of data and for what purpose data is collected and to whom this data may be shared with. Finally, the Operator informs users about their rights as well as internal rules for data storage.";True;True;['(hereinafter', '“user”', '“users”']
com.shpock.android;This Privacy Policy is a supplement to the terms and conditions and applies to the use of the Shpock services and the utilisation of all other offered services on Shpock. The privacy policy applied refers to the policy available online at Shpock at the time of a user’s specific visit or at the time of the specific use of a Shpock service.;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;This privacy policy is translated from the original German version. Please note that if this privacy policy is inconsistent with the privacy policy in German, the German version prevails.;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;II Data collection and processing;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;The Operator collects data in connection with the registration of an account and also in connection with subsequent use of the Shpock services. In order to give a good overview of how the processing of personal data is carried out, the personal data has been divided into three categories based on how it is collected:;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;1. Data that is given to us by the user;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;When an account is created or activities are carried out through the framework of the account, personal information about the individual user is needed. Personal data in this category is characterised by the fact that the user actively provides the data to us by, e.g. completing a web form, reporting incidents to support, or providing us with feedback through functions created for such purposes.;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;To facilitate the registration for users and to reduce the threat of scammers and spammers the user has three ways of registering an account:;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;a. Registration via Facebook Connect:;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;The Operator accesses user data, which is saved in the individual’s Facebook-Profile. The user agrees to share this data with the Operator during the registration process. This permission can be revoked at Facebook at any time. Of course, the Operator does not have access to the users’ Facebook-Login data. The Operator is not liable or responsible for wrong or unauthorized data transfers from Facebook. In order to preserve a certain amount of anonymity towards other users, only the profile picture of the user, the first name and the last name abbreviated to the first letter (John D.) instead of the full name (John Doe) is shown to other users.;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;b. Registration via Google Sign in:;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;The Operator accesses user data, which is saved in the individual’s Google-Profile. The user agrees to share this data with the Operator during the registration process. This permission can be revoked at Google at any time. Of course, the Operator does not have access to the users’ Google-Login data. The Operator is not liable or responsible for wrong or unauthorized data transfers from Google. In order to preserve a certain amount of anonymity towards other users, only the profile picture of the user, the first name and the last name abbreviated to the first letter (John D.) instead of the full name (John Doe) is shown to other users.;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;c. Registration with E-Mail and SMS-confirmation:;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;The Operator hereby accesses the data of the user, which he has specified during the registration process, i.e. name, e-mail address and telephone number. The profile data given by the user must be correct, complete and must continuously be kept up-to-date. In order to preserve a certain amount of anonymity towards other users, only the profile picture of the user, the first name and the last name abbreviated to the first letter (John D.) instead of the full name (John Doe) is shown to other users.;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;2. Data collected when you use the Shpock services;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;By using the Shpock services and carrying out activities, the user provides data which is stored by the Operator in its database. This process takes place for user recognition and to ensure the delivery of the service that the user has requested. The Operator will also store information when the user contacts the Operator, for example when the user e-mails the Operator’s customer support, so that the Operator can assist the user and answer open questions. The Operator may use anonymous and aggregated data about such inquiries to improve its services.;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;By using the Shpock services, the Operator gathers information about individual user’s activity, e.g. which services and screens are visited within Shpock and how they are used. The collected data can be divided into the following types:;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;a. Technical information about the user’s device and internet connection;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;Through server logs and other tools the Operator records information about the user’s device and internet connection, including operating system, browser version, IP addresses, cookies and other unique identifiers. The technical information is usually processed as aggregated data in order to analyse how the Operator’s services are used. The Operator may, however, link such data to the user’s account, for instance so that the Operator can customize the Shpock-services to the User’s device.;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;b. Information about the use of the Shpock services;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;The Operator registers the user’s account activities such as logging in or out of the user account, and any purchase of products or services through the Shpock services. The Operator also stores information about a user’s visit on Shpock. The Operator uses this information, amongst other things, to prevent abuse and fraudulent activities, to improve the Shpock services and to provide users with personalised services, recommendations and informations.;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;c. Information about users’ location;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;When Shpock is used, the individual user’s location may be estimated through the IP or Geo-location detected on the individual’s device. This information is, for instance, used to show content or provide offers relevant to the user’s location. This is done to improve the Shpock services and to identify and display the location of the classified ads listed by the user. In order to avoid the identification of a user’s actual exact location, a displaced location of the seller is shown in the published classified ads.;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;d. Cookies and locally stored content;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;When the user uses the Shpock services the Operator applies various technologies in order to recognize the user. The Shpock website uses “cookies” in order to enable all functionalities of the Shpock website and to facilitate the use of the page. For instance, the Operator uses cookies so that the user does not have to log in every time he visits the Operator’s services. The Operator may also store anonymous identifiers locally on the user’s device, especially mobile devices that are incapable of using cookies. See Clause VII below for more information on cookies and anonymous identifiers.;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;3. Information from other sources;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;The Operator may from time to time receive information from other sources such as partners, ad networks and other third parties that help the Operator understand user activity and preferences. This is collected to improve the Shpock services. Examples of this include when the user creates a user account by connecting with his/her Facebook profile, and the Operator may add basic profile information. An advertising partner may also share information about what happened after the user had clicked on an ad on the Operator’s website, so that the Operator can measure the impact of an ad and provide more relevant content or advertisements. The analysis is usually carried out at an aggregated and anonymized level.;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;III Processing purpose;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;The Operator uses data of the user for the following purposes:;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;"The Operator processes data for the purposes of (1) delivering the Shpock services; (2) improving and developing the Shpock services; (3) delivering personalised advertisements, offerings and recommendations to the users; (4) identification of market trends; (5) preventing, limiting and investigating abuse of the Shpock services.";False;False;[]

com.shpock.android;2. Improvement and further development of the Shpock Services;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;The Operator uses information to improve its services, for instance by trying to make the registration, log in and payment processes for premium services as user-friendly as possible. This may result in, for instance, registering all steps (screen views, clicks) related to the search of a particular product in order to understand if certain elements of the process are confusing to the users or not. The analysis is usually carried out at an aggregated and anonymized level, but the Operator may also use identifiable data to provide technical support and to understand how each individual uses the Shpock services.;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;To improve the Shpock services and to detect and analyse errors, the Operator uses certain tracking-tools. Therefore, the Operator traces user behaviour independently as well as via third-party suppliers (e.g. Google Analytics, Firebase, Crashlytics).;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;The Operator may inform the user about changes to or improvements of the Shpock services by using his e-mail address or – if the user uses mobile devices - through push notifications.

com.shpock.android;4. Identification of market trends;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;The Operator analyses data to understand market trends in order to improve, develop and customise the Shpock services.

com.shpock.android;We use information to restrict various forms of abuse of the Shpock services, such as fraudulent activities, denial of service attacks, spamming, unauthorized logins and other actions that violate our Terms & Conditions, or are prohibited by law.;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;IV Legal Basis for data processing;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;If the operator processes personal user data such processing is necessary for the performance of the contractual services or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the operator.;False;False;[]

com.shpock.android;V Usage of data by third parties;False;False;[]
com.shpock.android;For all services, that use social networking functionalities such as the Facebook-like button or the Google +1 button, please be aware, that Facebook and other suppliers of social networks can collect user data even if the user is not registered on the page or has not specifically approved the data transfer.

com.wgxa.android.weather;"TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Overview. The information we gather generally falls into one of two categories: (1) personal information (for example, your name and address) that you voluntarily supply when you register with our Service, initiate transactions on or through the Service (such as buying products or services through the Service), or when you participate in the features we offer through the Service (such as comments posted on a blog, discussion group, or other social networking features on the Service), and (2) information gathered on usage patterns and preferences as visitors navigate through our Service. In some cases, one of our agents or Affiliates may collect the information on our behalf. Third party Service Providers (as defined below) that provide all or some of the services available through this Service also may be gathering the same kinds of information on our behalf.";False;False;[]
com.wgxa.android.weather;Registration Information. To make use of certain features available through this Service (such as to receive email newsletters, to post a classified ad, or to participate in some social networking features) you may need to register and to provide certain personal information as part of the registration process. (If permitted by this Service, you may be able to bypass some of the steps within the registration process by using your user name and password associated with your account on certain specified social networking sites when you register for our Service, but you will still have to complete the registration process after entering that information.) We or our Service Providers may also ask for personal information from you if you buy products or services or conduct other transactions via our Service. (We may ask, for example, for your name, email address, sex, age, zip code or credit card number, and we might request information on your interest in sports, personal finance, the performing arts, and the like.) The personal information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our Service to your interests and make them more useful to you, and also may be used in the processing of e-commerce transactions. In addition, our Service Providers may provide us with additional personal information about you that you provide to them through your separate accounts with them as described in their own privacy statements.;False;False;[]
com.wgxa.android.weather;"
The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying such personal information is entirely voluntary. But if you don’t supply the personal information we request, we may be unable to provide you with services we make available to other users of our Service. For instance, we can’t send you an email alerting you to a new service we’re offering, or breaking news that may interest you, if you don’t tell us what you’re interested in and give us your email address.";False;False;[]

Contests and Other Promotions. From time to time, we may offer contests, sweepstakes or other promotions via our Service. If you enter one of these contests, sweepstakes or promotions, you’ll have to provide personal information about yourself (such as your name, address, telephone number and email address) so that we can administer and operate the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion (including contacting you if you win, fulfilling a prize, and publishing a winners’ list).

We may use these tools and other technologies to recognize which links visitors click and to track how users respond to ads we place on third-party sites or applications. These features may also be included in our email newsletters so that we can learn which messages have been opened and acted upon. In combination with cookies, these web beacons allow us (and/or our Affiliates, Service Providers, vendors, or advertisers) to track the number of users who view particular pages and to fine tune the advertising messages delivered to users of this Service and other websites and applications. We may use “clickstream” data collected using web beacons and cookies to help us tailor promotional content, including such content in email messages and on landing pages, to the perceived interests of our users.

DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION";False;False;[]
com.wgxa.android.weather;Why We Collect Information From You. Like any business, it’s important for us to know our customers — their needs, their likes, what they want and expect from us. Unlike most businesses, however, we deliver a valuable product to our customers without asking for anything in return. Since we make most of this Service available without charge to you, we rely heavily on advertisers to produce the income necessary to operate our Service. Advertisers are like most people: They expect something in return for the money they spend. They want to know how many people will see their ad and how often our users are looking at their ads on our Service — in other words, how effective their ad is likely to be. So it’s important that we be able to tell advertisers who our audience is. Except as expressly set forth in this Privacy Statement, we will not provide, sell or rent to any third party any personal information that we collect from you through your use of this Service.;False;False;[]
com.wgxa.android.weather;Advertisers. Without your permission, we will not share the personal information you provide when registering on our Service with advertisers. We may, however, take the information you provide and aggregate it with data from all the other people that use this Service and associated services. Then we will use that pool of information to inform our advertisers about our audience without identifying you personally.;False;False;[]
com.wgxa.android.weather;Service Providers. All or portions of our Service may be provided or supported by our third-party service providers (“Service Providers”), and we may share any of the information that we collect from you through our Service (e.g., information collected through cookies on your browser, personal information you submit to us to enter a contest, sweepstakes or promotion offered through the Service, etc.) with such Service Providers. In the event we offer services through this Service such as chat, email newsletters, email services, online classifieds and/or similar services, such services may be made available through cooperative arrangements with providers that specialize in operating such services. We will only work with trusted Service Providers who provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organisational security measures governing the processing to be carried out and who can demonstrate a commitment to compliance with those measures. We do not allow Service Providers to use your personal information for their own purposes, unless indicated, and only permit them to process your personal information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.;False;False;[]

If you enter any contest, sweepstakes or other promotion that we make available through this Service, we may share the personal information you submit to us with the co-sponsor(s) of the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion.

The Third Party Outlets are not sponsors to, nor in any way affiliated with, any of the Company’s Promotions (defined below), nor any of our Services or the Youth Rewards Site and Features.";True;False;[]

com.youth.youthrewards;"By using the Youth Rewards Site and Features or our Services, you represent and warrant that you: (i) have the power and authority to enter into and be bound by these Terms; (ii) shall use the Youth Rewards Site and Features and our Services only as permitted by these Terms, and any applicable Additional Terms, and not for any unlawful purpose; and (iii) are sixteen (16) years of age or older (or any older age legally required under local law to bind yourself legally to these Terms). If you are under the age of 16 (or any older age legally required under local law to bind yourself legally to these Terms), you are not allowed to use the Youth Rewards Site and Features nor our Services.

com.youth.youthrewards;Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions;False;False;[]
com.youth.youthrewards;Any sweepstakes, contests or promotions (collectively, “Promotions“) that may be offered via the Youth Rewards Site and Features or our Services may be governed by Additional Terms, which may set out eligibility requirements, such as certain age or geographic area restrictions, terms and conditions, and details governing how your personal information may be used. It is your responsibility to read all Additional Terms to determine whether or not you want to or are eligible to participate, enter or register in or for the Promotions. By participating in a Promotion, you will be subject to the Additional Terms and you agree to comply with and abide by such Additional Terms and the decisions of the sponsor(s) thereof. The Third Party Outlets are in no way associated with the Promotions.;False;False;[]
com.youth.youthrewards;Rewards Programs;False;False;[]
com.youth.youthrewards;"Overview The Company may offer one or more rewards programs (“Rewards Programs“) under which you may have the opportunity to earn points (in the Youth Rewards.com program, such points are called “Cents“), which are redeemable for rewards (“Rewards“). Not all of the Youth Rewards Site and Features offer Rewards Programs, however, and Rewards Programs may include Additional Terms that apply to your participation in activities allowing you to earn points (collectively, “Activities“). The Company may limit, suspend or terminate your ability to participate in a Rewards Program in its sole and absolute discretion, and may void any points, Rewards, or potential Rewards you may have earned or accumulated in a Rewards Program, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have not complied with these Terms or any Additional Terms applicable to such participation. You agree to abide by the final and binding decisions of the Company regarding any Rewards Program and your participation in it. We reserve the right to change, suspend, or cancel all or a portion of a Rewards Program, including any points you may have accrued, at any time. We will generally use reasonable efforts to provide notice to you of any material change to or a suspension or cancellation of a Rewards Program. Earning Points Points can be earned in a Rewards Program by participating in certain Activities, as described in the Youth Rewards Site and Features. If you choose to participate and follow the instructions associated with an Activity, upon satisfying all of the requirements of the Activity, you will be awarded the points associated with completing that Activity so long as the Company and/or its third-party Rewards Program affiliates are able to properly track your valid and completed point-earning Activities. For avoidance of doubt, Company shall not be responsible for, nor shall Company be obligated to award points or Rewards to Rewards Program participants for, any Activity that is not properly recorded, tracked and/or deemed approved under Company’s or its third-party Rewards Program affiliates’ policies, procedures and systems, and any points or Rewards previously granted may be revoked in appropriate circumstances. There may be limitations on Activities and Rewards, so please be sure to review all applicable Additional Terms before deciding whether or not you would like to participate. For example, we reserve the right to request and verify receipts of completed purchases prior to or in connection with the awarding of points for shopping Activities in order to verify with the applicable merchant that such purchases are valid. You agree that we may also contact you by phone, SMS or text (including using an automated dialing system) for the purpose of verifying transactions and/or avoiding potential fraud or misuse of our Youth Rewards Sites and Features. Some of the limitations on Activities and rewards include (without limitation), our right to change or limit your ability to participate in certain Activities or the Rewards Program itself; our right to change or limit the allowable frequency of Activities; our right to change or limit the number of points you can earn for a given Activity or during a given time period; and our right to change the Activities or Rewards available, or the number of points required for a particular reward. Points awarded have no cash value. Redeeming Points You may redeem points you have earned for Rewards offered in a Rewards Program pursuant to these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms. Supplies may be limited. Rewards may be awarded on a first-come, first-serve and while-supplies-last basis. If you attempt to redeem points for a Reward and the Company determines that the Reward is unavailable, out of stock, or for whatever reason cannot be provided to you, the Company may, at its sole and absolute discretion, provide you with a Reward of equal or greater value. No credit, reversal, or refund of points will be issued for any reason after points have been redeemed; in other words, once you order a Reward, you may not cancel the Reward or return the Reward for a refund of points. The only way to use points is to redeem them for Rewards Program Rewards as available from time to time through the Youth Rewards.com Rewards Store at https://www.Youth Rewards.com/rewards-store, or other applicable Rewards Program redemption sites, as applicable. Some Rewards may have eligibility requirements and in that case the Company reserves the right to verify your identity (by requesting photocopy of your driver’s licence or state ID card, or other proof as we may require) and eligibility qualifications to our complete satisfaction prior to crediting points or fulfilling any Reward in any Rewards Program, or otherwise providing you with any benefit. Delivery of Rewards Rewards may be emailed to your email address that you provided when you registered and created an account (“Account“) for the applicable Rewards Program, or to the email that our records show your Account was last updated to reflect. Processing times may vary. Rewards that are undeliverable or unclaimed for whatever reason (including, without limitation, because your Account information is incorrect or outdated) may be forfeited, and the points will not be refunded. Rewards Program Points Nontransferable Rewards Program points are non-transferable, may not be bartered or sold, and are void if a transfer is attempted, and such points and the associated Account are not transferable upon death, as part of a domestic relations matter or otherwise by operation of law. Inactive Accounts Any Account that has not been logged into and points either earned or redeemed for one year or more may be deemed inactive and the Account closed. We may either close the Account completely or remove any points in the Account and treat it as inactive, as we elect. In such instances, to request Account reactivation (subject to such terms, limitations and requirements as we may impose from time to time) you may reach us by using the “Contact Us”, “Contact Member Services” or similar contact link in the footer of the Youth Rewards Site or Features. We may modify the foregoing inactive Account rules and policies in our Rewards Programs from time to time. Points Expiration Any points in our Rewards Programs that have not been redeemed for two (2) years from the time such points were earned or awarded may be deemed expired and removed from your Account. In such instances, to request re-crediting of the expired points to the Account (subject to such terms, limitations and requirements as we may impose from time to time) you can reach us by using the “Contact Us”, “Contact Member Services” or similar contact link in the footer of the Youth Rewards Site or Features. We may modify the foregoing points expiration rules and policies for any points in our Rewards Programs from time to time.";False;False;[]

com.zodiactouch;"Use of the ‘Google Analytics’ analysis tool
We use the Google Analytics service from Google Ireland Ltd, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. This service makes it possible to analyse the use of our web pages. To do so, it uses cookies. For this purpose, the information generated by the cookie, such as your anonymised IP address, is transmitted on our behalf to a Google Ireland Ltd. server in the USA, and is stored and evaluated there. This is because Google Analytics has been given the extension code ‘gat._anonymizeIp();’ on this website. This ensures the anonymised collection of IP addresses. The anonymisation of your IP address is generally done through the truncation of the IP address by Google Ireland Ltd. within the European Union or in other member states of the European Economic Area (EEA). In exceptional cases, your IP address will be transferred to a server of Google Ireland Ltd. in the USA and only anonymised there. Your IP address transmitted through this process is not merged with other Google Ireland Ltd. data. In the context of the Google Analytics advertising function, remarketing and reports are used to provide services based on demographic features and interests. These procedures help align advertising measures more closely with the interests of the respective users, aided by the information about user behaviour. In the context of remarketing, personalised advertising measures can be displayed on other websites based on the user’s surfing behaviour on the apo-rot website. In this process, advertising materials may contain products which the user has looked at before on the apo-rot website. Provided you have agreed that your web and app browser history can be linked to your Google account and that information from your Google account can be used to personalise advertisements. Google will use this data for remarketing purposes across multiple devices. Any products that allow inferences to be made on the state of health of the user are excluded from these procedures by apo-rot. You can object to the collection of your data by Google Analytics at any time. To do so, you have the following options:";False;False;[]
