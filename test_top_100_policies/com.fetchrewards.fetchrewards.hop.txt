Friend information when you Refer a Friend or participate in Social : When you refer a friend to join Fetch we provide you a link, some pre-formatted text relating to Fetch, and a referral code to send your friend. You send your friend the link, along with the pre-formatted text, and referral code on your own, and you do not share any of your friend's information with Fetch.

Refer a Friend: If your friends sign up using the "refer a friend" referral code that you as your friends' advocate provided, we will let them know that their advocate has received points for the referral, and we will let you know that your friends have signed up and notify you when they scan their first receipt.
Social: If your friends sign up using a referral code inviting them to be your Fetch friend, after that friend enters your referral code, they will be added to your Fetch friends list and you will be added to that friend's list of Fetch friends in Fetch Social.
If you invite someone to be a friend who is already a Fetch member, we will provide your friend a push notification, which will take them to the Fetch App where they can accept your invitation. If they accept, we will automatically add that friend to your list of Fetch friends and you will be added to that friend's list of Fetch friends.
We collect and display in each Fetch Social feed and leaderboard, the user names and profile photos of the friends with whom you directly connect, along with certain Fetch activity information.
We collect information about the people, pages, account activity, and groups you are connected to and how you interact with them on our App.

For GoodRx Participants: We distribute GoodRx Cards through our App on behalf of GoodRx, Inc. that contain certain GoodRx information, including BIN, PCN, Group, and Member ID. You choose whether to activate your GoodRx Card by making a GoodRx Claim. When you activate your Good Rx Card, we provide your GoodRx Card information, name, and email address to GoodRx to enable you to engage with GoodRx and facilitate your relationship with GoodRx. The GoodRx Privacy Policy [link] governs your relationship with GoodRx. When you activate your GoodRx Card and make GoodRx Claims, you direct GoodRx to provide Fetch your GoodRx Card Member ID and information relating to your transactions, including the pharmacy name and zip code and amount of savings associated with your GoodRx Claims, so that Fetch can provide you points.

We may communicate with you based on your location, and when we do so, we do that through our App's push notifications. We do not use your geo-location as a basis for sending you text or SMS messages. If you do not want to receive push notifications, you can disable that through your Fetch App Settings. We will collect precise real-time geolocation data only if you consent. You may opt out of using location services using your device's functionality to do so, but this may degrade the features and functionality that we can provide.
