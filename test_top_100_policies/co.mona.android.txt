4. What data we collect about you

Personal data

Personal data, or personal information means any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual.

This is usually by reference to an identifier such as a name, identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the identification of a particular person, also constitute personal data. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data). More information could be found here.

Special categories of personal data

Certain types of sensitive personal data are subject to additional protection under the legislation applicable to you. They are called “special categories” of personal data. The special categories are:

Personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin.
Political opinions.
Religious or philosophical beliefs.
Trade union membership.
Genetic data and biometric data processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person.
Data concerning health.

The anti-money laundering legislation of the UK also requires us to process personal data in a similar way. See also the respective row in the table below which describes the purposes for which we will use your personal data.

Marketing

We may use your Identity Data, Contact Data, Technical Data, Transactional Data, Investment Data, Usage Data and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).

You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us and consented to receive marketing communications, or if you have purchased from us and you have not opted out of receiving such communications. We will use your Marketing and Communications Data for our respective activities.

Third-party marketing

We will get your opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.

Opting out

You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you.

Further, you can let us know directly that you prefer not to receive any marketing messages by emailing dpo@crypto.com.

Where you opt out of receiving marketing messages, this will not apply to service messages which are directly related to the use of our Services (e.g. maintenance, change in the terms and conditions and so forth).

Cookies

You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of the Services or Site may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please review the Cookie Preferences.

Change of purpose

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Sale or transfer of business

We may also need to process your data in connection with or during the negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving all or a part of our shares, business or assets. This will be based on our legitimate interests in carrying out such transaction, or to meet our legal obligations.

7. Disclosures of your data

We share your personal data with our third-party service providers, agents, subcontractors and other associated organizations, our group companies, and affiliates (as described below) in order to complete tasks and provide the Services and use of the Crypto.com App to you on our behalf. When using third party service providers, they are required to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.

We may pass your personal data to the following entities:

companies and organizations that assist us in processing, verifying or refunding transactions/orders you make and in providing any of the Services that you have requested;
identity verification agencies to undertake required verification checks;
fraud or crime prevention agencies to help fight against crimes including fraud, money-laundering and terrorist financing;
anyone to whom we lawfully transfer or may transfer our rights and duties under the relevant terms and conditions governing the use of any of the Services;
any third party because of any restructure, sale or acquisition of our group or any affiliates, provided that any recipient uses your information for the same purposes as it was originally supplied to us and/or used by us; and
regulatory and law enforcement authorities, whether they are outside or inside of the EEA, where the law allows or requires us to do so.
8. International transfers

We share your personal data within our group. This will involve transferring your personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK.

Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA or the UK so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA or the UK.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA or the UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

the country to which we transfer your personal data has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission;
a specific contract approved by the European Commission which gives safeguards to the processing of personal data, the so called Standard Contractual Clauses.

Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA or the UK. Please also note that future changes to the Standard Contractual Clauses are expected for transfers from the UK. When this situation arises, we will comply with the guidance provided by the UK supervisory authority in this regard.

9. Data security

While there is an inherent risk in any data being shared over the internet, we have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used, damaged, or accessed in an unauthorised or unlawful way, altered, or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a legitimate business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

Depending on the nature of the risks presented by the proposed processing of your personal data, we will have in place the following appropriate security measures:

organisational measures (including but not limited to staff training and policy development);
technical measures (including but not limited to physical protection of data, pseudonymization and encryption); and
securing ongoing availability, integrity, and accessibility (including but not limited to ensuring appropriate back-ups of personal data are held).

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any relevant regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

If you want to know more about our security practice, please visit this link.

10. Data retention

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

Here are some exemplary factors which we usually consider when determining how long we need to retain your personal data:

in the event of a complaint;
if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you or if we consider that we need to keep information to defend possible future legal claims (e.g. email addresses and content, chats, letters will be kept up to 10 years following the end of our relationship, depending on the limitation period applicable in your country);
to comply with any applicable legal and/or regulatory requirements with respect to certain types of personal data:
under the EU Anti-Money Laundering legislation (Anti-Money Laundering Directives) we are obliged to retain your personal data for a period of 5 years after the end of the relationship between us as a company and you as a customer; this period may be further extended in certain cases if so provided by and in accordance with the applicable legislation; the same is valid also under the anti-money laundering legislation of the UK;
if information is needed for audit purposes and so forth;
in accordance with relevant industry standards or guidelines;
in accordance with our legitimate business need to prevent abuse of the promotions that we launch. We will retain a customer’s personal data for the time of the promotion and for a certain period after its end to prevent the appearance of abusive behaviour.

Please note that under certain condition(s), you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information. We will honor your deletion request ONLY if the condition(s) is met.

11. Your legal rights

You have rights we need to make you aware of. The rights available to you depend on our reason for processing your personal data. If you need more detailed information or wish to exercise any of the rights set out below, please contact us.

You may:

request access to your personal data, which enables you to obtain confirmation of whether we are processing your personal data, to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and information regarding how your personal data is being used by us;
request rectification of your personal data by asking us to rectify information you think is inaccurate and to complete information you think is incomplete, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us;
request erasure of your personal data by asking us to delete or remove personal data we hold about you; note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you;
object to the processing of your personal data, where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms; in some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms; you also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes;
require that decisions be reconsidered if they are made solely by automated means, without human involvement; we use automated tools to make sure that you are eligible to be our customer taking into account our interests and legal obligations; if these automated tools indicate that you do not meet our acceptance criteria, we will not onboard you as our customer;
request restriction of processing your personal data, which enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data, if you want us to establish the data accuracy; where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it; where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or if you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;
request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party, and we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen (where technically feasible), your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format; note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you;
withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent; if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you, but we will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent;
complain to the IDPC, ICO, DPC or any relevant authority about any perceived violation and to seek compensation for damages in the courts.

No fee usually required

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

Period for replying to a legitimate request

The statutory period under GDPR for us to reply to a legitimate request is one month. That period may be extended by two further months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests.

Please note that we may request that you provide some details necessary to verify your identity when you request to exercise a legal right regarding your personal data.
