CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Passive Information

DoubleDown may collect passive information such as your device ID, IP address, referral data, browser type, browser language, platform type, type of mobile or other computing device, and geographical data, such as zip code and geographic location. Your browser or device typically sends passive information to our servers without your intervention whenever you visit our Website or Apps and use the Services. For example, your browser or device may tell us your IP address (which may tell us generally where you are located) and the type of browser and device you are using. When you visit our Website or Apps, your browser may also tell us information such as the page or link that led you to our Website or Apps and, if applicable, the search terms you typed into a search engine that led you to our Website or Apps.

Cookies
While you are using the Services, we may seek to place a "cookie" (a small data file) or other tracking technology on your mobile device, computer or other participating device. If you access our Website, Apps or Services via a Partner Site, the Partner Site may also place cookies on your device as permitted by the terms of the agreement and your privacy settings with the Partner Site. Cookies placed by us are not used to obtain any personal data, and the information that is tracked is used only for internal purposes, such as to improve the Services. If you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your web browser on your computer or device to reject them or to alert you before one is placed. Be advised, however, that some of our features and services may not function properly if you disable cookies.

Personal Information
Personal information, which is sometimes referred to as personally identifiable information, means information that is specific to you and can be used to contact or identify you. Unless you are using the Services on a guest basis, you must have a valid, active Facebook account to use and access the Services. Accordingly, we receive from Facebook certain categories of personal information about you that you authorize Facebook to disclose, such as your user name, date of birth, friend list, email address and profile picture, or you may voluntarily disclose information such as your gender or your play preferences to us through your use of the Services. Any information directly collected through your Facebook account and shared with us will be imported, used and stored in a manner consistent with the Facebook Platform Policy applicable to developers in effect at the time of collection (see https://developers.facebook.com/policy/) and in compliance with any specific privacy settings set by you of which we are aware.

We may also collect certain categories of personal information from vendors that help us to operate the Website and Apps and provide services such as processing credit card payments and sending emails on our behalf. For example, we may receive confirmation that you have made a payment by credit card and other information related to any of your gaming transactions associated with your use of the Services. To help keep our databases current and to provide you the most relevant content and experiences, we may combine personal information from you with information from public sources and our trusted partners, in accordance with applicable law and this Privacy Policy.

Please note that because a third-party vendor manages your purchases of virtual currency for use the Services, we do not have access to your credit card or billing information. Be advised that this Privacy Policy does not apply to this and other third-party vendors.

DoubleDown Online Advertising
DoubleDown utilizes online advertising, including displaying DoubleDown advertisements to you across the Internet on websites and in applications. We collect information about which of our advertisements are displayed, which advertisements are clicked on, and on which web page the advertisement was displayed.

Third Party Advertising
DoubleDown permits third parties to place advertisements on our properties, including our Website, Apps and the Services. When advertisers or advertising networks place advertisements on DoubleDown properties, they may collect or we may share the following types of information from within our properties:

• performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);
• aggregated and/or de-identified information about you and other players collectively that is not intended to specifically identify you (like players between the ages of 30 and 40 who also own a Lamborghini);
• certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, non-permanent and anonymous device identifiers such as Apple Identifier For Advertisers (IDFAs), and Google Advertising ID);
• your social network ID;
• other contextual data about your game play (for example, games played and session length).

Offer Walls
DoubleDown games or their purchase pages may display an "Offer Wall" that is hosted by a third-party provider. The offer wall allows third party advertisers to provide virtual currency or other rewards to players in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those advertisers. These offers are not made by DoubleDown. These offers may be shown to you based on certain technical information, like your geographic area or de-identified demographic information. After clicking on one of these offers, you will no longer be on a site hosted by DoubleDown or the social network through which you are playing DoubleDown's games. To properly credit player accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier, in some cases your social network ID or DoubleDown player ID, will be shared with the Offer Wall provider.

This Privacy Policy shall apply even if we transfer personal information to other countries.

Access to and Ability to Correct Personal Information
For residents of the European Economic Area (EEA), we advise that your personal information will be transferred to and processed in the United States, which has data protection laws that are different than those in your country and may not be as protective. The United States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR.

Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information or information is to do so with your consent; where we need the personal information for performance of a contract, or where the collection and use is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

If we ask you to provide Personal information to us to comply with a legal requirement or enter into a contract, we will inform you of this and let you know whether providing us with your Personal information is required and if not, the consequences of not sharing your personal data with us.

Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal information in reliance on our or a third party's legitimate interests and those interests are not already described above, we will let you know what those legitimate interests are.

USERS IN CALIFORNIA

California Do Not Track Disclosures
The California Online Privacy Protection Act (“CalOPPA”) requires that online privacy notices disclose how a site responds to "Do Not Track" signals ("DNT"). We currently do not honor DNT signals.

California “Shine The Light”
If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (“Shine-The-Light” law) permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by us, or our subsidiaries or affiliates, to a third party for the third party’s direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us as provided below. Except as may be provided in this Privacy Policy, we do not trade, sell, lease or otherwise provide any personal information regarding our users to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) gives California consumers enhanced rights with respect to their personal information that is collected by businesses. First, California consumers may opt out of having their personal information sold to other persons or parties. Second, they can request to know: What specific pieces of information a business has collected about the consumer;
Categories of personal information it has collected about the consumer;
Categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;
Categories of personal information that the business sold or disclosed for a business purpose about the consumer;
Categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and
The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.

Third, California consumers can request that a business delete personal information about the consumer that a business has collected from the consumer.

DoubleDown may be considered a covered business under the CCPA as it collects and processes the personal information of California consumers. This Privacy Policy provides the required notices to California consumers. The CCPA also prohibits covered businesses from providing discriminatory treatment to California consumers if they exercise their rights under the Act.

DoubleDown does not presently sell any personal information to third parties for any purpose.

We will confirm receipt of your request within 10 business days. We must provide the requested information or delete your personal information within 45 days of receipt of your request, but we can use up to an additional 45 days if we let you know that additional time is needed.

Before responding, we must verify that the person making the request is the person about whom we have collected their personal information. Therefore, we may ask you to provide certain, limited personal information, such as your name and email address to verify and match your identity with our records and systems. If you have an account with us, we may ask that you verify your identity through our standard account authentication process. This is also to protect against fraud.
