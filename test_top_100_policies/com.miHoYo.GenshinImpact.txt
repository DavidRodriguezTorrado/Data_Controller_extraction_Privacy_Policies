COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. ("COGNOSPHERE", "we", "our", or "us") greatly recognizes and values the privacy of people ("you" or "User") who visit our websites, use or access our games, whether played on mobile devices, PCs, our websites or other approved platforms ("COGNOSPHERE Game(s)"), and/or otherwise use or access any of our provided services, including but not limited to customer support, marketing and advertising, and community services (collectively the "COGNOSPHERE Services" or "our services").

The minimum age to create a user account ("Account") is 13. Insofar as certain countries or platforms apply a higher age of consent for the collection of personal data, COGNOSPHERE requires parental or guardian consent before an Account is created and personal data associated with it is collected.

This Privacy Policy applies to any and all of the COGNOSPHERE Services and describes why and how we collect, store, and use your personal data, and the choices and rights you have about the personal data you provide or we collect in connection with the COGNOSPHERE Services. By accessing our websites or otherwise using the COGNOSPHERE Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and accepted the following terms. In the case you do not agree to any of the terms, some basic functions in the COGNOSPHERE Game(s) may not be able to run normally, which may prevent you from using them.

In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy or other similar event, we will make an announcement in advance, disclose the details of the event and information about the successor, and with the express consent of you and/or your parent and/or guardian (if applicable) again, your personal data may transfer to the successor. COGNOSPHERE may periodically modify, adjust or revise the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will announce to you the updated terms and obtain your consent (and/or the consent of your parent/guardian, if applicable) again. You acknowledge and agree to check the updated terms regularly. If major clause changes are involved, we will make an announcement in advance.
