First Public Working Draft: MediaStreamTrack Insertable Media Processing using Streams

10 February 2022 | Archive

The Web Real-Time Communications Working Group has published a First Public Working Draft of MediaStreamTrack Insertable Media Processing using Streams. This JavaScript API allows to process raw video, either before it gets encoded or after it gets decoded, e.g. to add effects such as background blur to real-time video.

It builds on WebCodecs to expose the bytes that a video processing program needs to operate on. An earlier version of the API is available in Chromium, with demos that illustrate its usage.
