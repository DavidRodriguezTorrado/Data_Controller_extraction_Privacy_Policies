Create a repository

Head over to GitHub and create a new public repository named username.github.io, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.

If the first part of the repository doesn’t exactly match your username, it won’t work, so make sure to get it right.

What git client are you using?
A terminal GitHub Desktop I don't know
Clone the repository

Go to the folder where you want to store your project, and clone the new repository:

~$git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io

Hello World

Enter the project folder and add an index.html file:

~$cd username.github.io

~$echo "Hello World" > index.html

Push it

Add, commit, and push your changes:

~$git add --all

~$git commit -m "Initial commit"

~$git push -u origin main

…and you're done!

Fire up a browser and go to https://username.github.io.
