THE APACHE WAY

Our consensus-driven, open development process was refined over the past 20 years and produced some of the largest and longest-lived Open Source projects that have revolutionized the industry.

CONFERENCES

"Tomorrow's Technology Today" since 1998. Intentionally intimate, offering unparalleled educational, networking, and collaboration opportunities.

The ASF develops, shepherds, and incubates hundreds of freely-available, enterprise-grade projects that serve as the backbone for some of the most visible and widely used applications in computing today. Through the ASF's merit-based process known as "The Apache Way," more than 840 individual volunteer Members and 8,200+ code Committers across six continents successfully collaborate on innovations in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, Big Data, Build Management, Cloud Computing, Content Management, DevOps, IoT and Edge Computing, Mobile, Servers, and Web Frameworks, among other categories.

APACHE IS …

OPEN: The Apache Software Foundation provides support for 350+ Apache Projects and their Communities, furthering its mission of providing Open Source software for the public good.

INNOVATION: Apache Projects are defined by collaborative, consensus-based processes, an open, pragmatic software license and a desire to create high quality software that leads the way in its field.

COMMUNITY: We are a community of developers and users of enterprise-grade, Open Source Apache projects used in every Internet-connected country on the planet.

APACHE PROJECTS

The all-volunteer ASF develops, stewards, and incubates more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives that cover a wide range of technologies. From Accumulo to Zookeeper, if you are looking for a rewarding experience in Open Source and industry leading software, chances are you are going to find it here. Are you powered by Apache?
