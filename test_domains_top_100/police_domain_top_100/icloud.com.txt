 Privacy

Privacy is a fundamental human right. At Apple, it’s also one of our core values. Your devices are important to so many parts of your life. What you share from those experiences, and who you share it with, should be up to you. We design Apple products to protect your privacy and give you control over your information. It’s not always easy. But that’s the kind of innovation we believe in.

Apple News leaves what you read off the record.

Apple News delivers content based on your interests, but it isn’t connected to your identity. So Apple doesn’t know what you’ve read.

Wallet and Apple Pay help hide what you buy.

Your credit and debit card numbers are hidden from Apple, and Apple doesn’t keep transaction information that can be tied back to you.
