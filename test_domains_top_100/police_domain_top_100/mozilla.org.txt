Websites, Communications & Cookies Privacy Notice
March 8, 2021

We care about your privacy. When Mozilla (that's us) collects information about you, our Mozilla Privacy Policy describes how we handle that information.

This privacy notice applies to Mozilla operated websites and mobile apps, which include the domains mozillians.org, mozilla.org, and firefox.com, among others. This includes, for example, foundation.mozilla.org, bugzilla.mozilla.org, reps.mozilla.org, careers.mozilla.org, developers.mozilla.org, support.mozilla.org, addons.mozilla.org, and wiki.mozilla.org.

Things you should know

We may receive personal information from you based on your interaction with us on social media platforms; if you submit a job, intern, grant, or fellow application; if you volunteer as a Mozilla community member; if you submit user feedback or a request to us; if you sign up for an account or for a subscription; or if you engage with a product or policy campaign. 

We may use cookies, clear GIFs, third party web analytics, device information, and IP addresses for functionality and to better understand user interaction with our products, services, and communications. 

You can control individual cookie preferences, indicate your cookie preferences to others, and opt-out of web analytics and optimization tools. 

Some Mozilla websites allow you to make purchases (such as apps or gear), contribute funds to specific Mozilla projects, or make donations in support of Mozilla public and charitable programs. These transactions are often handled by Mozilla’s third party vendors.
