Your Privacy is Our Priority. Message Privately.

Our mission is to connect the world privately by designing a product that's simple and private. Whether you are sending a personal message to your friends or family, or texting with a business, your communications are secure and you are in control.

Your privacy is automatic
Hello

End-to-end encryption

Conversations in end-to-end encrypted chats are clearly labeled with a gold message; these messages and calls stay between you, and no one else can read or listen to its content, not even WhatsApp.

Messages are stored on your device

Your messages belong to you. That's why your messages are stored on your phone, and we don't share them with advertisers.
