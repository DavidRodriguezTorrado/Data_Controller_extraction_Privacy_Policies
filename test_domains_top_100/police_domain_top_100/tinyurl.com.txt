Privacy Policy
Effective April 7, 2021

TinyURL LLC ("TinyURL", "we", or "us") values your trust and a key part of earning your trust is being upfront and clear in how we gather and use your information. We created this Policy to inform you on what data we collect, how we collect your data, how we share your data, and your rights around the data. This Policy applies when you use our services available through TinyURL.com ("Site") either as creator of a TinyURL Link (as defined below) or clicking on a TinyURL Link. For the purposes of this Policy, the Site, features, content, applications, and other services provided by TinyURL will be referred to as the "Services". This Policy works in conjunction with the Site’s Terms of Use. Any capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this Policy have the meanings provided in the Terms of Use. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our Services. By accessing or using our Services, you agree to this Policy.

Controller and Processor

Data protection laws and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions differentiate between "controllers" and "processors" of personal information. A controller decides why and how to process personal information. A processor processes personal information on behalf of a controller based on the controller’s instructions. When you create a TinyURL Link (a "User"), we are acting as a controller. When you click on a TinyURL Link created by a User, we are acting as a processor.

Broadly speaking, we use Personal Information to further our legitimate interests to:

understand who our users are,
manage our relationship with you and other Users,
carry out core business operations such as billing and fulfilling regulatory obligations; and
help detect, prevent, or investigate security incidents, fraud, and other abuse or misuse of our Services.
WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT

While using our Services we may collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you ("Personal Information"). This does not include aggregated or de-identified information that is maintained in a form that is not reasonably capable of being associated with or linked with you.

Directly from You

You may provide us with Personal Information in several ways.

Account Creation: When you create an account, we collect personal information from you such as your name, email address, and other relevant information (your "Account"). If you create an Account using your login from a third-party account, such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, or Microsoft, we will access and collect your personal information provided by that third-party account. The amount of information that is shared with us from that third-party account depends on your privacy settings on your third-party account.
Create a TinyURL Link: By using our Services, Users can create shortened URLs of websites ("TinyURL Link" or "TinyURLs). Users can create TinyURLs without registering for an Account. When you create a TinyURL Link, TinyURL collects and stores the original URL and the shortened URL and links it with your session. This applies to both User who are logged in and to those who are not.
User Support: If you contact us for assistance or support, we may collect your name, email address, or any other content that you send us.
Social Media Interaction: We may collect information from your social media account if you interact with our social media presence.

Information Collected Automatically

Log Data: When you use our Services, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user, our servers may automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you create or use a TinyURL Link ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device settings (such as browser type, operating system, language), the time and date you create the TinyURL Link, the referring website, the time and date of each access, device settings, and analytics on the sharing of the TinyURL Link on third party services, such as Facebook. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services, for the Site's technical administration, to increase our Site's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors` needs.
Mobile Devices: We may collect information from your mobile device, such as unique identifying information broadcast from your device when visiting our Services.
Cookies and Similar Technology: "Cookies" are a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Please see our Cookie Policy for more information.

Information We Collect from Other Sources

Social Media Services: Our Services allow you to interact with social media platforms and other third-party services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn). If you choose to share your TinyURL Link using third party services, we may collect information related to your use of those third-party services. Additionally, if you access the Services using one of these social media platforms or other third-party services, we may receive information about you from those third parties such as account and profile data. Please note that third-party services may have the ability to restrict the information that is provided to us based on your privacy settings of that account.

No Special Category of Personal Data

We do not require or collect any sensitive personal data or any special category of personal data, as such terms are defined under applicable privacy laws, as a condition of using the Services.

Purposes for Which We Use Your Personal Information

These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
Analytics and Search Engine Providers: We may share Personal Information with analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimization of the Service.
Feedback: We may collect feedback from you about your experience to compare your experience with other Users of the Services to improve the quality of the Services. This feedback is the property of TinyURL, and we reserve the right to share it with any third-party.
Acquisition, merger, or bankruptcy: TinyURL may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy.
Disclosures without Your Consent: We may disclose information in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process, or to comply with relevant laws. We may also share your information in the event of an emergency, to establish or exercise our rights, to defend against a legal claim, to investigate, prevent, or act regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, the safety of person or property, or a violation of our policies.
Disclosures with Your Consent: We will share information about you when you instruct us to do so, such as when you share TinyURLs or content with others through the Services or if we notify you that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information (such as posting it to a third-party service).

We may also share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose non-identifying information and Log Data to parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling, and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.

Marketing and Advertising

We use your Personal Information to tailor our marketing and advertising efforts. To do this, we provide your information to third party advertising networks (such as Google Doubleclick) and social media companies (such as Facebook, Instagram, and other social media platforms). When we provide data to agencies, ad networks, and other parties for targeted advertising, we do not provide them with your name, financial information, or any sensitive information. We use online identifiers such as email, cookies, and device identifiers to help us provide targeted advertising to you and others like you.

Do Not Track Signals

Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do regarding these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or act with respect to "Do Not Track" signals. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

Email Marketing

If you sign up for our Services, we will send you marketing emails. If you change your mind, you can opt-out at any time by selecting the unsubscribe option when you receive an electronic marketing communication from us. The withdrawal of your consent will not impact the lawfulness of processing based on your consent prior to the withdrawal.

Please note that even if you opt-out of receiving commercial emails, you will still receive emails that are transactional in nature, such as actions taken on your account, updates to our online policies, and other transactional communications.

This is only for the purposes of providing, and to the extent necessary to provide, the Services to you.
