D. EU-US Privacy Shield frameworks
As described in our Privacy Shield certification, we comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland, respectively. The Company has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. The Company remains responsible for any of your personal information that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for external processing on our behalf, as described in the Section 4. To learn more about the Privacy Shield programme, and to view TELEMAC’s certification, please visit the Privacy Shield website.

If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our Privacy Shield certification, we encourage you to contact us at privacy@telemac-inc.com. The Company is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain circumstances, the Privacy Shield Framework provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the Privacy Shield Principles.

E. Model contract clauses
The European Commission has approved the use of model contract clauses as a means of ensuring adequate protection when transferring personal data outside of the European Economic Area. By incorporating model contract clauses into a contract established between the parties transferring personal data can be protected when transferred outside the European Economic Area to countries (other than USA) which have not been deemed by the European Commission to adequately protect personal data.
