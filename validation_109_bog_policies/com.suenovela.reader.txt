THIS PRIVACY POLICY IS IMPORTANT. WE HOPE YOU WILL TAKE THE TIME TO READ IT CAREFULLY.

B. Age restrictions

STARY is not intended for children. Children under the age of 13 must not use our Site, Application, and/or Services for any purpose. STARY will never knowingly solicit or accept personally identifiable information or other content from a user or visitor who STARY knows is under 13 years of age. If STARY discovers that a user under 13 years of age has created an account, or that a user or visitor under 13 years of age has posted personally identifiable information or other content to the Service, STARY will terminate the account and remove the information or other content.

Users between 13 and 18 (each a “Teen”) may not access or use the Service unless (i) both the Teen and their parent or legal guardian have first agreed to these Terms of Service; and (ii) the Teen uses an account established by their parent or legal guardian, under such parent or guardian’s supervision, and with such parent or guardian’s permission.  If you permit a Teen to use the Services, you hereby agree to these Terms of Service on behalf of both yourself and the Teen.

C. Data Collection

We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services– from figuring out basic stuff such as which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the author who matter most to you online or which stories you might like.

When you interact with our Site, Application, and/or Services, we collect information that could be used to identify you (“Personal Data”). Some of the information we collect is stored in a manner that cannot be linked back to you (“Non-Personal Data”).

When you log in, we collect information that we store with your account (typically your nickname, email address, and a password for your account), which we treat as personal information. This log information may include but not limited to your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query and cookie data. If you log into STARY with a social networking credential, such as with a third-party account, we will ask permission to access basic information from that account, such as your name and email address. You can stop sharing that information with us at any time by removing STARY’s access to that account. When you do not log in to our services, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the application and device you’re using. This collection helps us do things such as maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.

We collect your payment information if you are a paying customer. This information is required to complete a commercial transaction on our Applications and our Sites. We use this information to enable and fulfill your transaction. If you choose to use any third-party’s service to finalize and pay for your order, you will provide your credit card number directly to the third-party. The privacy policy of the third-party will apply to the information you provide on its website.

If you choose to participate in our survey, we may request certain Information (including Personal Data and Non-Personal Data) from you, and this information will be used to provide personalized help and instructions. `

The information we collect and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
