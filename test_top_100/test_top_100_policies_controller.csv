11. DISCLAIMER REGARDING SECURITY AND THIRD PARTY SITES
11.1 WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA AND/OR OTHER INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE ON THIRD PARTY SITES. We do implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal data that is in our possession or under our control. Your personal data is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the personal data confidential. When you place orders or access your personal data, we offer the use of a secure server. All personal data or sensitive information you supply is encrypted into our databases to be only accessed as stated above.
 
11.2 In an attempt to provide you with increased value, we may choose various third party websites to link to, and frame within, the Site or Games. We may also participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer e-commerce and other services and features to our visitors. These linked sites have separate and independent privacy policies as well as security arrangements. Even if the third party is affiliated with us, we have no control over these linked sites, each of which has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us. Data collected by our co-brand partners or third party web sites (even if offered on or through our Site or Games) may not be received by us. 
 
11.3 We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content, security arrangements (or lack thereof) and activities of these linked sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our Site and Games and the links placed upon each of them and therefore welcome any feedback about these linked sites (including, without limitation, if a specific link does not work).

We use cookies (access data files) which save the user's personal information in order to provide a specialized service that is customized and personalized to our users, as well as for analytics and tracking purposes. Cookies are small pieces of data (text files) that are sent by the website server to the user's browser or app and saved on the user's computer and other devices. With respect to its operation, our cookies distinguish between the users' computer or mobile phones but do not differentiate the individual users.
You have a right to choose whether the cookies are installed or not.

14. Security
We take security seriously and put in place measures to protect your information
We have in place appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data, including:
In order to protect the unauthorized disclosure of users' personal data from hacking or any external break-ins, we currently use an equipment that blocks any external break-ins, which protects the data from any hacking, attacks, or unauthorized access, and we also use encryption, etc., so that personal data may be transferred safely. In particular, the server containing users' personal data is managed separately so that is not directly linked to the external internet line.
In preparation for any unexpected emergencies, we have a policy to back-up the system and data. We are taking protective measures to try and minimize damages caused by computer viruses by using vaccines that are regularly updated. Only the minimum number of people have right of access to the users' personal data. We regularly train our staff who handle personal data on new security technology and personal data protection obligations. Further, through an internal designated personal data protection unit, etc., we try and correct any errors immediately upon detection by checking the company's personal data processing procedure implementation and the relevant personnel's compliance with the personal data protection policies.
15. Where your information is transferred and stored
We may store, transfer and use your data outside your country.
In general, your data will be stored in Japan, the United States of America and the Republic of Korea, where our servers are located. 
In the event that we transfer your personal data to another country and where the country or territory in question does not maintain adequate data protection standards, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that any such transfers is undertaken in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, please note that where personal data is stored in another country, it may be accessible to law enforcement agencies in accordance with domestic laws.
16. Legal bases for processing your information
We rely on certain lawful bases to collect, use and share data about you if you are in the EU.
For users located in the EU only, the GDPR requires us to inform you of the different legal bases that we rely on to legitimize our processing of your personal data. We have described these below.
Where you give us your consent to process your personal data
We are allowed to use your personal data where you have specifically consented. In order for your consent to be valid: 
It has to be given freely, without us putting you under any type of pressure;
You have to know what you are consenting to – so we'll make sure we give you enough information;
You should only be asked to consent to one thing at a time – we therefore avoid ""bundling"" consents together so that you don't know exactly what you're agreeing to; and
You need to take positive and affirmative action in giving us your consent – for example, we could provide a tick box for you to check so that this requirement is met in a clear and unambiguous fashion.
We currently seek your consent for marketing and advertisement purposes.  
Before giving your consent you should make sure that you read any accompanying information provided by us so that you understand exactly what you are consenting to.
You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, and details can be found in the ""Right to withdraw consent"" paragraph in the link on your rights above.
Where processing your information is within our legitimate interests
We are allowed to use your personal data where it is in our interests to do so, and those interests aren't outweighed by any potential prejudice to you.
We believe that our use of your personal data is within a number of our legitimate interests, including but not limited to:
To handle customer complaints;
To verify your identity;
To ensure that our systems run smoothly;
To protect against improper use or unauthorized use of our Games; and
To market our Games.
We don't think that any of the activities set out above will prejudice you in any way. However, you do have the right to object to us processing your personal data on this basis. We have set out details regarding how you can go about doing this in the link on your rights above.
Where processing your personal data is necessary for us to carry out our obligations under our contract with you
We are allowed to use your personal data when it is necessary to do so for the performance of our contract with you. For example, we need to process certain personal data about you in order to be able to provide you with the Games and related services (including Games branded websites) which you have requested from us and in order to govern the relationship between you and Smilegate Megaport. 
Where processing is necessary for us to carry out our legal obligations
As well as our obligations to you under any contract, we also have other legal obligations that we need to comply with, and we are allowed to use your personal data when we need to comply with those other legal obligations.
This Privacy Policy should come into effect from June. 10, 2020

July 16, 2021
OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY
Venmo, a PayPal, Inc. service, knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Our primary goal is to provide you with exceptional service, and we understand that you may have questions or concerns regarding your personal information and how it will be used. To make this privacy policy easy to find, we make it available from the home page of the Venmo website at venmo.com (the ""website"") and through our mobile applications. You may also email us at privacy@venmo.com with any privacy-related questions you have.
APPLICABILITY OF PRIVACY POLICY
This privacy policy applies to all information we collect through our Services from current and former Venmo users, including you. “Services” means any products, services, content, features, technologies, or functions, and all related websites, applications and services offered to you by PayPal, Inc. in connection with a Venmo account. When you are no longer our customer, we continue to share your information as described in this policy. This policy only applies to the Services and does not apply to the practices of any other PayPal service.
Throughout this policy, we use the term ""personal information"" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been aggregated and/or anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
When you visit the website or use one of our mobile applications or other Services, we collect your IP address, and standard web log information, such as your browser type and the pages you accessed on our website. We also may collect Geolocation Information (defined below). If you do not agree to our collection of this information, you may not be able to use our Service. 
If you open a Venmo account, we collect the following information from you:
Account Information - text-enabled cellular/wireless telephone number, machine or mobile device ID and other similar information.
Identification Information - your name, street address, email address, date of birth, and SSN (or other governmental issued verification numbers).
Device Information - information about you: (a) from your mobile device or computer such as your device type, machine or mobile device identification number, Geolocation Information, time zone, language setting, browser type, and IP address, and (b) from third parties for purposes of transaction processing, identity verification, fraud detection or prevention and other similar purposes. For fraud prevention purposes, we also may link your machine ID with the machines of others who use your same payment cards.
Geolocation Information - information that identifies with reasonable specificity your location by using, for instance, longitude and latitude coordinates obtained through GPS, Wi-Fi, or cell site triangulation. We will collect this data for fraud and risk purposes. In addition, some of our Services may ask you for permission to share your current location within your device settings to enhance our Services. If you do not agree to our collection of Geolocation Information, our Services may not function properly when you try to use them. For information about your ability to restrict the collection and use of Geolocation Information to enhance our Services, please refer to the settings available in your device.
Social Web Information - including but not limited to your Facebook Connect credentials and email account information. If you authorize Facebook Connect, the plug in allows us access to your email address, Facebook friends list, and public profile (including profile picture). We also allow you to import data from other social web services, including but not limited to Twitter, FourSquare, and email service providers. Social and e-mail contact information helps you connect to friends and contacts for invitation and payment transmission purposes (as well as helping us improve the Services and fight fraud). Additionally, another Venmo user may mention you in a transaction to which you are not a party by “tagging” your username in a transaction note or comment. When you are mentioned in a transaction note or comment into which you have visibility (e.g., a public transaction, a “friends only” transaction by one of your Venmo friends, or a comment on either such transaction), a link to your Venmo profile will appear in the transaction note or comment and, if your push notifications are turned on, you will receive a push notification about the mentions. You may manage certain contact preferences and notifications in your account settings.
Financial Information - bank account online login information, bank account and routing numbers and credit cards linked to your Venmo account. Venmo does not share financial information with third party social networking services such as those listed in the prior bullet.
We are committed to providing a safe, secure and all around great service. Therefore, before permitting you to use the Services, we may require additional information from you we can use to verify your identity, address or other information or to manage risk and compliance throughout our relationship. We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as identity verification, fraud prevention and similar services.
When you are using the Services, we collect information about your account transactions and we may collect Geolocation Information and/or information about your computer or other access device for fraud prevention and other similar purposes.
Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here. For example, we may collect information related to your contact with our customer support team or store results when you respond to a survey.
INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN
The Services are not directed to children under the age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete it, unless we are legally obligated to retain such data. Contact us if you believe that we have mistakenly or unintentionally collected information from a child under the age of 13.
HOW WE USE COOKIES
When you visit or use our Services, or visit a third-party website for which we provide online services, we and certain business partners and vendors may use cookies and other tracking technologies (collectively, ""Cookies""). We use Cookies to recognize you as a customer; customize Services, other content and advertising; measure the effectiveness of promotions; perform a wide range of analytics; mitigate risk and prevent potential fraud; and to promote trust and safety across our Services.
Certain Services are only available through the use of Cookies, so if you choose to disable or decline Cookies, your use of certain Services may be limited or not possible.
Do Not Track: Do Not Track (""DNT"") is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. We do not respond to DNT signals.
HOW WE PROTECT & STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION
We store and process your personal information using third party servers located in data centers in the United States. This information is protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state regulations. We also use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our office and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.
We strive to ensure security on our systems. Despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee that personal information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of our administrative, managerial and technical safeguards. Therefore, we urge you to take adequate precautions to protect your personal data as well, including never sharing your Venmo password with anyone.
If Venmo learns of a systems security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Services, you agree that Venmo may communicate with you electronically. Venmo may post a notice on the website or mobile application if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice of a security breach), please email us at privacy@venmo.com
HOW WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, fun and customized experience. We may use your personal information to:
provide the services and customer support you request;
process transactions and send notices about your transactions or your network activity;
resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;
prevent potentially fraudulent, prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement through the use of our risk and fraud tools which may include use of Account Information, Identification Information, Financial Information, Device Information, Social Web Information and Geolocation Information;
create an account connection between your Venmo account and a third-party account or platform;
customize, personalize, measure, and improve our services and the content and layout of our website;
send you updates about new products and services that we are offering to customers;
compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties;
perform other duties as required by law; and
if you elect to share your Geolocation Information, we will use this information to enhance the security of the Services and we may use this information to provide you with location-specific options, functionality, offers, advertising, search results, or other location-specific content.
HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHIN THE VENMO NETWORK
To process payments on Venmo, we need to share some of your personal information with the person or company that you are paying or is paying you. Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received and other verification metrics like social graph activity may be provided to users or companies when you transact with, on, or through Venmo.
We work with vendors to enable them to accept payments from you using Venmo. In doing so, a vendor may share information about you with us, such as your mobile phone number or Venmo username, when you attempt to pay that vendor. We use this information to confirm to that vendor that you are a Venmo customer and that the vendor should enable Venmo as a form of payment for your purchase.
Regardless, we will not disclose your credit card number or bank account number to anyone you have paid or who has paid you through Venmo, except with your express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with a subpoena or other legal process.
HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHER PARTIES
Venmo does not share your personal information with third parties for their promotional or marketing purposes.
Some personal information is public information and may be seen by anyone on the internet, whether or not they have a Venmo account. Public information may also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through Venmo's APIs or third-party services that integrate with our products.
Public information for personal profiles includes your Venmo username, profile photo, first and last name, month and year of Venmo account creation, and public transactions in which you've been involved.
Public information for business profiles includes Venmo username, profile and background photos, business name, business description, and QR code. Public information for business profiles may be indexed by and searchable on search engines.
In addition to any public information, your Venmo friends list may be seen by any logged-in Venmo user; you may adjust or turn off this setting in the privacy section in your account settings.
We may share your personal information with:
Our parent company, PayPal, Inc. and affiliates and subsidiaries it controls, but only for purposes allowed by this document.
Companies that PayPal, Inc. plans to merge with or be acquired by or, in the event of any bankruptcy, a bankruptcy estate. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information could be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice and the opportunity to communicate preferences you may have, if applicable.
Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties if PayPal is compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure, when it is necessary to do so to comply with law, or where the disclosure of personal information is reasonably necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of the Venmo User Agreement, or as otherwise required by law.
Third party service providers who assist us in providing services to you or who provide fraud detection or similar services on our or any vendor’s behalf.
The other Venmo user participating in the transaction and, depending on the privacy setting of each Venmo account transaction, your Venmo friends and the Venmo friends of the other user participating in the transaction, or the public, through the Venmo feed on our website and mobile application and elsewhere on the internet.
Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations (for example, fraud prevention, payment processing, or technology services). Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
Other third parties with your consent or at your direction to do so, including if you authorize an account connection with a third-party account or platform.
For the purposes of this privacy policy, an ""account connection"" with such a third party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Venmo account and a non-Venmo account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own. When you authorize such a connection, Venmo and the third-party will exchange your personal information and other information directly. Examples of account connections include, without limitation: linking your Venmo account to a social media account or social messaging service; connecting your Venmo account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Venmo account log-in credentials; or using your Venmo account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Venmo account.
If you connect your Venmo account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and account and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers. If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service. For example, if you connect your Venmo account to a social media account, we will receive personal information from the social media provider via the account connection. We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this privacy policy.
Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices. Before authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your personal information as part of the account connection. For example, personal information that Venmo shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.
If you choose to use Siri or iMessage to send payments via Venmo or to otherwise use the Services, such use is subject to Apple’s terms and conditions for use of iMessage and/or Siri, as applicable, and the terms of the Venmo User Agreement. By using Siri or iMessage, you authorize us to share some of your Venmo account data (including your friends list, list of persons you have transacted with most recently and most frequently, transaction instructions, and transaction notes) with Apple to allow it to facilitate transaction requests made through Siri or iMessage on iOS. Data shared with Apple will be used pursuant to Apple’s then-current user agreements and privacy policies. You can grant or revoke Apple’s access to Venmo on iOS at any time under the “Siri” or “iMessage” settings on your iPhone.
Venmo does not send your personal information to third-party social networks unless you have specifically requested or authorized us to do so. When you broadcast information to such third-party social networks, such information is no longer under the control of Venmo and is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of such third parties.
HOW YOU CAN ACCESS OR CHANGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
You can review and update your personal information in your account settings at any time by logging in to your account.
LINKS TO OTHER SERVICES OR SITES
The Services may contain links to (or allow you to link to) other third-party services or websites. Venmo does not control the information collection of third-party services or websites that can be reached through such links. We encourage our users to be aware when they are linking to a third-party service or website and to read the privacy statements of any third-party service or website that collects personally identifiable information.
CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
Venmo is always improving. As the Services evolve we may occasionally update this privacy policy. If we modify this privacy policy, we will post the revised privacy policy to the website, and we will also revise the ""last updated date"" stated above. If we make material changes in the way we use personal information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our mobile application or website or by sending you an e-mail. It is your responsibility to periodically review this privacy policy; users are bound by any changes to the privacy policy by using the Services after such changes have been first posted.

POLÍTICA DE PRIVACIDAD DE SHEIN
Fecha de entrada en vigor:29 de septiembre de 2021
Introducción y descripción general
Esta Política de privacidad ( «Política» ) explica cómo se recopila, utiliza, comparte y trata su información personal al acceder a este sitio web o utilizar otros servicios proporcionados por su administrador, incluidas las comunicaciones escritas, electrónicas y orales, en línea o fuera de línea, y las compras realizadas (colectivamente, los «Servicios» ), así como los derechos y opciones que usted tiene asociados con esa información.
Los Servicios incluyen cualquier servicio ofrecido a través de este sitio web, ubicado en SHEIN.com (el «Sitio» ), que incluye versiones locales del Sitio, como fr.shein.com o de.shein.com; nuestras aplicaciones móviles (las «Aplicaciones» ); nuestras cuentas y páginas de fans en plataformas de redes sociales (las «Cuentas de redes sociales» ), y cualquier otro sitio web, páginas, características o contenido propiedad de la Empresa y gestionados por ella que tengan un hipervínculo a esta Política.
La empresa que vende los productos a través del Sitio y las Aplicaciones y que ofrece los Servicios (y, por tanto, la entidad de cobro de pagos) es Infinite Styles Ecommerce Co., Ltd., con domicilio social en 1-2 Victoria Building, Haddington Road, Dublín 4 (Irlanda), que actúa como corresponsable del tratamiento de la información junto con Roadget Business Pte. Ltd., con domicilio social en 7 Temasek Boulevard, #12 07 Suntec Tower One, Singapur (038987). Por lo tanto, los términos «Empresa», «nosotros», «nos» o «nuestro» se refieren a Infinite Styles Ecommerce Co., Ltd. y Roadget Business Pte. de forma colectiva, como corresponsables del tratamiento.
Lea nuestros Términos y condiciones y esta Política antes de utilizar o acceder a nuestros Servicios. Si no puede aceptar esta Política o los Términos y condiciones, no utilice ni acceda a nuestros Servicios.
La Empresa gestiona los Servicios y la venta de productos de la marca SHEIN y, por lo tanto, es la responsable de sus datos personales, y también es responsable del tratamiento y la protección de dichos datos.
Los corresponsables indicados anteriormente han celebrado un acuerdo de corresponsabilidad, y han asignado las responsabilidades esenciales de la siguiente manera: Roadget Business Pte. Ltd. será responsable de administrar el Sitio y de garantizar su seguridad. Infinite Styles Ecommerce Co., Ltd, para la Unión Europea, será responsable de utilizar el Sitio en su territorio correspondiente para vender productos a los clientes, cobrar los pagos y tramitar las devoluciones. El acuerdo de corresponsabilidad es necesario debido a la mencionada separación de los niveles técnicos y comerciales, mientras que al mismo tiempo el tratamiento de sus datos es necesario para ambas empresas, respectivamente, para proporcionarle los Servicios generales (compuestos tanto por las ventas como por el Sitio y las Aplicaciones).
Derecho a modificar esta Política: Podemos cambiar esta Política ocasionalmente para reflejar cómo estamos tratando sus datos, y si hacemos cambios, le notificaremos actualizando la fecha de entrada en vigor o los últimos datos modificados en la parte superior de esta Política. Si realizamos cambios significativos que afecten sustancialmente a sus derechos de privacidad, le avisaremos con antelación y dejaremos claros los cambios en el sitio web de SHEIN u otros servicios de SHEIN, o mediante otros medios de contacto, como el correo electrónico, para que pueda revisar los cambios antes de seguir utilizando los Servicios. Si no está de acuerdo con la Política modificada, deje de utilizar los Servicios o no consienta las actualizaciones.
Información instantánea: además, podemos ofrecerle divulgaciones en tiempo real o información adicional sobre las prácticas de tratamiento de información personal de partes específicas de nuestros Servicios. Dichos avisos pueden complementar esta Política o facilitarle opciones adicionales sobre cómo tratamos su información personal.
